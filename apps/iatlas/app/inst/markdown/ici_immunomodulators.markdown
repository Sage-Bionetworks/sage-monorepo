Select an immunomodulator gene to see the distribution of gene expression within sample groups of the ICI Datasets selected in ICI Cohort Selection. Samples can be further divided into an additional sub-group based on the availability of those groups for each dataset. Use the plot parameters to adjust the type of plot and choice of scale. A table with statistical tests comparing all pairwise combinations of groups, for each dataset, is provided at the bottom of the page. For an A vs B comparison, a positive t-statistics or Wilcox statistics corresponds to an elevated value in the A group over group B (Mean value in A greater than mean in B). The table also includes a comparison of the log2 fold change of groups. You can view a histogram for any individual distributions by clicking on its violin plot.
