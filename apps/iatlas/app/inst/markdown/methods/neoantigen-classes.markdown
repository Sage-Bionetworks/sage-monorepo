**Title:** Classes of predicted neoantigens

**Description:**
The classes of neoantigens predicted by LENS are:

- Somatic SNVs: Somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), or variants present within tumor tissue but absent from germline tissue. These peptides may be a direct result of a somatic variant or may be a downstream coding consequence of the variant.

- Somatic InDels: Somatic insertion/deletion variants (InDels), or variants present within tumor tissue but absent from germline tissue. These peptides may be a direct result of a somatic variant or may be a downstream coding consequence of the variant.

- Fusion Events: Scenarios in which a translocation, deletion, or inversion causes two previously genomically distant loci to become neighboring sequences or “fuse” within the genome are also of interest as sources of tumor antigens.

- Splice Variants: Aberrant splicing events create tumor-specific transcripts through intron retention, exon skipping, or altered splice targeting.

- CTAs and Self-antigens: These antigens are non-mutated self-antigens that may be overexpressed within a tumor. Antigens derived from these transcripts are commonly referred to as cancer testis antigens (CTAs).

- Virus: Some viruses, such as human papillomavirus, Epstein–Barr virus, human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type 1, and hepatitis C virus, are associated with development of cancers in the tissues they infect earning them the label of oncogenic viruses.

- ERVs: Aberrantly expressed endogenous retroviruses (ERVs).
