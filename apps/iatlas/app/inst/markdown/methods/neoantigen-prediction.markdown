**Title:** Neoantigen Prediction

**Description:**
Neoantigen prediction was performed using the Landscape of Effective Neoantigens Software (LENS) workflow (Vensko 2023).

For datasets where DNA and RNA sequencing data are available, we predicted tumor antigens from single nucleotide variants, insertion/deletions, gene fusions, splice variants, viral and endogenous retroviral genes, and cancer/testis antigens. For datasets where RNA sequencing data alone are available, we predicted tumor antigens derived from gene fusions, splice variants, viral and endogenous retroviral genes, and cancer/testis antigens only (Smith et al. 2019).
