**Title:** Neoantigen - Frequency of peptide-MHC combinations

**Description:**
Neoantigen prediction was performed using the Landscape of Effective Neoantigens Software (LENS) workflow (Vensko 2023).
We listed the 1% most common combinations of peptide-MHC (pMHC) across  datasets, and collected all occurrences of them. The known genes from which the most frequent pMHCs in the population are derived are included.

Several of the frequently observed pMHCs are result of different number of mutations. We computed how many mutations events, per patient, resulted in the pMHCs. We used this count and the number of patients who carry a given pMHC to generate the scatterplot.
