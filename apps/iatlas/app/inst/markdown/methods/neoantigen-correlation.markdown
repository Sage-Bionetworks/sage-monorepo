**Title:** Correlation of frequency of neoantigens with immune readouts

**Description:**

Neoantigen prediction was performed using the Landscape of Effective Neoantigens Software (LENS) workflow (Vensko 2023). For a selected type of neoantigen, a count of its frequency per patient was performed. The correlation was computed using this count and the feature values for the selected class of immune features, using the selected method (default to Pearson correlation coefficient).

The generated heatmap groups the samples based on dataset of origin and the grouping criteria selected in the Cohort Selection.
