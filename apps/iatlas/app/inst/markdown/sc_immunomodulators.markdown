Select an immunomodulator gene to see the distribution of pseudobulk single-cell RNA-seq gene expression within cell types of the selected datasets.

Pseudobulk values were computed by aggregating the expression values from a group of cells from a cell type from the same individual.

Samples can be further divided into an additional sub-group based on the availability of those groups for each dataset. Use the plot parameters to adjust the type of plot and choice of scale. A table with statistical tests comparing all pairwise combinations of groups, for each dataset, is provided at the bottom of the page. For an A vs B comparison, a positive t-statistics or Wilcox statistics corresponds to an elevated value in the A group over group B (Mean value in A greater than mean in B). The table also includes a comparison of the log2 fold change of groups. You can view a histogram for any individual distributions by clicking on its distribution plot.
