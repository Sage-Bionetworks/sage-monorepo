GWAS were performed on 33 immune traits that demonstrated nominally significant heritability (p < 0.05) in at least one ancestry group.  Here you can visualize the significant (p < 10 <sup>-6 </sup>) GWAS hits, as a Manhattan plot.

*Choose Immune Feature(s)* of interest to select or exclude the GWAS hits associated with trait(s). You can add multiple GWAS tracks, with different selection of immune features, or leave the *Choose Immune Feature(s)* field empty and visualize all available results.

More information on a particular SNP, including links to external resources,  can be obtained by clicking on the Manhattan plot, or by searching on the dropdown menu on the right.

Manuscript context: For an image similar to Figure 4A, choose "Select" in the *Select or Exclude?* menu, select immune feature “IFN 21978456”, and hit *Add GWAS Track*. Use the IGV navigation bar to select the region of interest.
