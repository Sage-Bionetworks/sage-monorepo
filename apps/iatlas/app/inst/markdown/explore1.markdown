Explore immune response in tumor tissue samples from **Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI)** studies or **Cancer Genomics (CG)** studies, using CRI iAtlas Analysis Modules for interactive visualization.

Begin by selecting either a cohort from available studies on molecular response to ICI (**ICI Cohort Selection**) or a CG cohort (**CG Cohort Selection** for TCGA or PCAWG).  You can also select **Data Description** on the left navigation bar to learn which immune readouts are available.
