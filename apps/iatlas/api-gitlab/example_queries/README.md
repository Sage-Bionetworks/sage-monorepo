# iAtlas API - Example Queries

[BACK TO MAIN README](./../README.md)

[BACK TO TESTING README](./../tests/TESTING.md)

Each graphql file in the [`example_queries`](./) folder has one or more examples. In the comments at the bottom of each file may be an example of variables to pass. These may be used in the graphiql playground when doing manual testing.

More examples may be found in the iAtlas application repo [here](https://github.com/CRI-iAtlas/iatlas.api.client/tree/master/inst/queries)
