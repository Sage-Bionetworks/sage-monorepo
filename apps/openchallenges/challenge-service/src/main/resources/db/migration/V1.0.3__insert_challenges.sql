However different algorithms use different methods for calculating TMB. Mutations in genes in tumor cells may lead to the creation of neoantigens, which have the potential to activate an immune system response against the tumor, and the likelihood of an immune system response may increase with the number of mutations. Thus, TMB is a biomarker for some immunotherapy drugs, called immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as those that target the PD-1 and PD-L1 pathways (Chan et al., 2019).  An outstanding problem is the lack of standardization for TMB calculation and reporting between different assays.

Fortunately, most kidney tumors are discovered early while they''re still localized and operable. However, there are important questions concerning management of localized kidney tumors that remain unanswered [2], and metastatic renal cancer remains almost uniformly fatal [3]. Kidney tumors are notorious for their conspicuous appearance in computed tomography (CT) imaging, and this has enabled important work by radiologists and surgeons to study the relationship between tumor size, shape, and appearance and its prospects for treatment [4,5,6].

However different algorithms use different methods for calculating TMB. Mutations in genes in tumor cells may lead to the creation of neoantigens, which have the potential to activate an immune system response against the tumor, and the likelihood of an immune system response may increase with the number of mutations. Thus, TMB is a biomarker for some immunotherapy drugs, called immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as those that target the PD-1 and PD-L1 pathways (Chan et al., 2019). An outstanding problem is the lack of standardization for TMB calculation and reporting between different assays.

This year, the captions are first processed before concept extraction, hence leading to a reduced number of concepts  As uncertainty regarding additional source was noted, we will clearly separate systems using exclusively the official training data from those that incorporate additional sources of evidence  Challenge description The first step to automatic image captioning and scene understanding is identifying the presence and location of relevant concepts in a large corpus of medical images. Based on the visual image content, this subtask provides the building blocks for the scene understanding step by identifying the individual components from which captions are composed. The concepts can be further applied for context-based image and information retrieval purposes.  Evaluation is conducted in terms of set coverage metrics such as precision, recall, and combinations thereof. This task will be run using a subset of the Radiology Objects in COntext ( ROCO ) dataset [1].  Data From the PubMed Open Access subset containing 1,828,575 archives, a total number of 6,031,814 image - caption pairs were extracted. To focus on radiology images and non-compound figures, automatic filtering with deep learning systems as well as manual revisions were applied, reducing the dataset to 72,187 radiology images of several medical imaging modalities.  NOTE: If the usage of an additional source for training is intended, it should not be a subset of PubMed Central Open Access (archiving date: 01.02.2018 - 01.02.2019), to avoid an overlap with the test data.

The greatest disaster that can happen to a patient with tuberculosis (TB) is that the organisms become resistant to two or more of the standard drugs. In contrast to drug sensitive (DS) tuberculosis, its multi-drug resistant (MDR) form is much more difficult and expensive to recover from. Thus, early detection of the drug resistance (DR) status is of great importance for effective treatment. The most commonly used methods of DR detection are either expensive or take too much time (up to several month). Therefore there is a need for quick and at the same time cheap methods of DR detection. One of the possible approaches for this task is based on Computed Tomography (CT) image analysis. Another challenging task is automatic detection of TB types (TBT) using CT volumes.  Differences compared to 2017: Scoring the severity of TB cases based on chest CT images is another task compared to both tuberculosis-related subtasks considered in 2017. There are no direct links between them. Note only that original CT image datasets used in 2017 and in 2018 may slightly overlap.  Challenge description The goal of this challenge is to assess the probability of a TB patient having resistant form of tuberculosis based on the analysis of chest CT scan. More information will follow soon.  Data For this task, a dataset of 3D CT images is used along with a set of clinically relevant metadata.

We work on the basis of a large-scale collection of figures from open access biomedical journal articles (PubMed Central). Each image is accompanied by its original caption, constituting a natural testbed for this image captioning task.  Lessons learned: In the first edition of this task, held at CLEF 2017, participants noted a broad topical variability among training images.

Challenge description On the basis of the concept vocabulary detected in the first subtask as well as the visual information of their interaction in the image, participating systems are tasked with composing coherent captions for the entirety of an image.

Evaluation of this second step is based on metrics such as BLEU that have been designed to be robust to variability in style and wording.  Data The collection comprises a total of 4 million image-caption pairs that could potentially all be used for training with a small subset being removed for testing.

About 130 years after its discovery, the disease remains a persistent threat and a leading cause of death worldwide according to WHO. This bacteria usually attacks the lungs, but it can also damage other parts of the body. Generally, TB can be cured with antibiotics. However, the different types of TB require different treatments, and therefore the detection of the TB type and the evaluation of the severity stage are two important tasks.  Challenge description This subtask is aimed at assessing TB severity score. The Severity score is a cumulative score of severity of TB case assigned by a medical doctor. Originally, the score varied from 1 ("critical/very bad") to 5 ("very good"). In the process of scoring, the medical doctors considered many factors like pattern of lesions, results of microbiological tests, duration of treatment, patient''s age and some other. The goal of this subtask is to assess the severity based on the CT image and some additional meta-data, including disability, relapse, comorbidity, bacillary and smoking among others.  Data In this edition, both subtasks (SVR and CTR) use the same dataset containing 335 chest CT scans of TB patients along with a set of clinically relevant metadata. 218 patients are used for training and 117 for test. The selected metadata includes the following binary measures: disability, relapse, symptoms of TB, comorbidity, bacillary, drug resistance, higher education, ex-prisoner, alcoholic, smoking.

This step aims at increasing the medical context relevance of the UMLS concepts For ImageCLEF 2022, an extended version of the ImageCLEF 2020 dataset is used To reduce the scope and size of concepts, several concept extraction tools are analyzed prior to caption pre-processing methods. Concepts with less occurrence will be removed As uncertainty regarding additional source was noted, we will clearly separate systems using exclusively the official training data from those that incorporate additional sources of evidence On the basis of the concept vocabulary detected in the first subtask as well as the visual information of their interaction in the image, participating systems are tasked with composing coherent captions for the entirety of an image. In this step, rather than the mere coverage of visual concepts, detecting the interplay of visible elements is crucial for strong performance.  Evaluation of this second step is based on metrics such as BLEU that have been designed to be robust to variability in style and wording. In this year we will evaluate other potential metrics like METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr.', NULL, 'https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/imageclef-2022-caption-caption-prediction', 'completed', 31, NULL, '2022-04-08', '2022-05-06', '2025-11-26 19:17:52', '2025-12-02 1:22:44'),

Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection caused by a germ called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. About 130 years after its discovery, the disease remains a persistent threat and a leading cause of death worldwide according to WHO. This bacteria usually attacks the lungs, but it can also damage other parts of the body. Generally, TB can be cured with antibiotics. However, the different types of TB require different treatments, and therefore the detection of the TB type and characteristics are important real-world tasks.  Task history and lessons learned:  Tuberculosis task exists in ImageCLEF since 2017 and it was modified from year to year. In the first and second editions of this task, held at ImageCLEF 2017 and ImageCLEF 2018, participants had to detect Multi-drug resistant patients (MDR subtask) and to classify the TB type (TBT subtask) both based only on the CT image. After 2 editions we concluded that the MDR subtask was not possible to solve based only on the image. In the TBT subtask, there was a slight improvement in 2018 with respect to 2017 on the classification results, however, not enough considering the amount of extra data provided in the 2018 edition, both in terms of new images and meta-data. In the 3d edition Tuberculosis task was restructured to allow usage of uniform dataset, and included two subtasks - continued Severity Score (SVR) prediction subtask and a new subtask based on providing an automatic report (CT Report) on the TB case. In the 4th edition, the SVR subtask was dropped and automated CT report generation task was modified to be lung-based rather than CT-based. Because of fairly high results achieved by the participants in the CTR task in 4th edition, the task organizers have decided to discontinue the CTR task and brought back to life the Tuberculosis Type classification task from the 1st and 2nd ImageCLEFmed Tuberculosis editions to check if recent Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods allows to improve previous rather low results. In this year''s edition the task is upgraded from classification problem to detection problem. This challenge (subtask) is about the detection itself: participants must detect lung cavern regions in lung CT images associated with lung tuberculosis. The problem is important because even after successful treatment which fulfills the existing criteria of recovery the caverns may still contain colonies of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis that could lead to unpredictable disease relapse.  Data The task dataset contains 559 train and 140 test cases. In addition, participants may also use 60 training cases from the Caverns Report task. Any other public dataset usage is also welcome.  Each case includes the CT image, two versions of automatically extracted lung masks, and information on cavern area location.  CT image  For all patients, we provide a single 3D CT image with an image size per slice of 512×512 pixels and the number of slices being around 100. All the CT images are stored in NIFTI file format with .nii.gz file extension (g-zipped .nii files). This file format stores raw voxel intensities in Hounsfield units (HU) as well the corresponding image metadata such as image dimensions, voxel size in physical units, slice thickness, etc. A freely-available tool called "VV" can be used for viewing the image files. Currently, there are various tools available for reading and writing NIFTI files. Among them, there are load_nii and save_nii functions for Matlab and Niftilib library for C, Java, Matlab and Python, NiBabel package for Python.  Lungs mask  For all the CT images we provide two versions of automatically extracted masks of the lungs. These data can be downloaded together with the patients'' CT images. The description of the first version of segmentation can be found here. The description of the second version of segmentation can be found here. The first version of segmentation provides more accurate masks, but it tends to miss large abnormal regions of lungs in the most severe TB cases. The second segmentation on the contrary provides more rough bounds, but behaves more stable in terms of including lesion areas. In case the participants use the provided masks in their experiments, please refer to the section "Citations" at the end of this page to find the appropriate citation for the corresponding lung segmentation technique.  Cavern area location  Cavern area location information includes a cavern area bounding box and cavern area centroid. This information is automatically extracted from manual segmentation masks. Please note, that source manual segmentation may have been done by different radiologists, therefore bounding boxes may be of different accuracy (for example, some margins may appear).  Note: A single CT can have none, one or multiple cavern regions. In some rare cases cavern regions may overlap.  Cavern areas bounding boxes are the prediction target in the task.   The file contains the following columns (header included):  id - train case id  bbox_X1, bbox_Y1, bbox_Z1 - coordinates of the first bounding box corner  bbox_X2, bbox_Y2, bbox_Z2 - coordinates of the second (diagonal) bounding box corner  centroid_X, centroid_Y, centroid_Z - coordinates of the cavern area centroid', NULL, 'https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/imageclef-2022-tuberculosis-caverns-detection', 'completed', 31, NULL, '2022-04-25', '2022-05-18', '2025-11-26 19:17:52', '2025-12-02 1:22:44'),
