Typically emerging around age 50, it affects about five in 100,000 people worldwide, with familial hereditary forms as the only known risk factors (5-10% of cases).  There is currently no cure for ALS. The FDA-approved drug Riluzole extends life by a few months. ALS patients, on average, have a life expectancy of 2-5 years, with 10% experiencing slower disease progression. Astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, living with ALS for 49 years, is an exceptional case.  The DREAM-Phil Bowen ALS Prediction Prize4Life, or ""ALS Prediction Prize,"" utilizes the PRO-ACT database with clinical data from over 7,500 ALS patients.

Human cancer cell lines represent a good model to help identify associations between molecular subtypes, pathways, and drug response. In recent years there have been several efforts to generate genomic profiles of collections of cell lines and to determine their response to panels of candidate therapeutic compounds. These data provide the basis for the development of in silico models of sensitivity based either on the unperturbed genetic potential of a cancer cell, or by using perturbation data to incorporate knowledge of actual cell response. Making predictions from either of these data profiles will be beneficial in identifying single and combinatorial chemotherapeutic response in patients.

"92","tumor-mutational-burden-tmb-challenge-phase-1","Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) Challenge Phase 1","Standardize tumor mutational burden (TMB) calculation in cancer research","Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is generally defined as the number of mutations detected in a patient's tumor sample per megabase of DNA sequenced. However different algorithms use different methods for calculating TMB. Mutations in genes in tumor cells may lead to the creation of neoantigens, which have the potential to activate an immune system response against the tumor, and the likelihood of an immune system response may increase with the number of mutations. Thus, TMB is a biomarker for some immunotherapy drugs, called immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as those that target the PD-1 and PD-L1 pathways (Chan et al., 2019).  An outstanding problem is the lack of standardization for TMB calculation and reporting between different assays. To address this problem, the Friends of Cancer Research convened a working group of industry and regulatory stakeholders to develop guidance and tools for TMB harmonization. Results from the first phase of this effort were presented at AACR 2020 (...","","https://precision.fda.gov/challenges/17","completed","6","","2021-06-21","2021-09-13","2023-06-23 00:00:00","2023-11-02 18:28:46"
"93","kits21","KiTS21","Contest seeks best kidney tumor segmentation system","The 2021 Kidney and Kidney Tumor Segmentation challenge (abbreviated KiTS21) is a competition in which teams compete to develop the best system for automatic semantic segmentation of renal tumors and surrounding anatomy. Kidney cancer is one of the most common malignancies in adults around the world, and its incidence is thought to be increasing [1]. Fortunately, most kidney tumors are discovered early while they're still localized and operable. However, there are important questions concerning management of localized kidney tumors that remain unanswered [2], and metastatic renal cancer remains almost uniformly fatal [3]. Kidney tumors are notorious for their conspicuous appearance in computed tomography (CT) imaging, and this has enabled important work by radiologists and surgeons to study the relationship between tumor size, shape, and appearance and its prospects for treatment [4,5,6]. It's laborious work, however, and it relies on assessments that are often subjective and impr...","https://rumc-gcorg-p-public.s3.amazonaws.com/logos/challenge/594/rendering_dimmed.png","https://kits21.grand-challenge.org/","completed","5","","2021-08-23","2021-09-17","2023-06-23 00:00:00","2023-11-28 00:32:11"
"94","realnoisemri","RealNoiseMRI","Brain MRI reconstruction challenge with realistic noise","In recent years, there is a growing focus on the application of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on prior knowledge. In the 1980s and 2000s the community used either purely mathematical models such as the partial Fourier transform or solutions derived through advanced engineering such as parallel imaging to speed up MRI acquisition. Since the mid-2000's, compressed sensing and artificial intelligence have been employed to speed up MRI acquisition. These newer methods rely on under sampling the data acquired in Fourier (aka k-) space and then interpolating or augmenting k-space data based on training data content. One of the underlying problems for the development of fast imaging techniques, that just as in e.g. [1], it is common to use a fully sampled image as ground truth and then under sample it in k-space in order to simulate under sampled data. The problem with this approach is that in cases were the under sampled data is corrupted, through e.g. motion, this under s...","https://rumc-gcorg-p-public.s3.amazonaws.com/logos/challenge/597/Logo_Challenge.png","https://realnoisemri.grand-challenge.org/","completed","5","","2021-09-21","2021-12-06","2023-06-23 00:00:00","2023-11-27 20:40:05"

Mitral valve repair, although considerably more difficult, is prefered over mitral valve replacement, since the native tissue of the valve is preserved. It is a complex on-pump heart surgery, often conducted only by a handful of surgeons in high-volume centers. Minimally invasive procedures, which are performed with endoscopic video recordings, became more and more popular in recent years. However, data availability and data privacy concerns are still an issue for the development of automatic scene analysis algorithms. The AdaptOR challenge aims to address these issues by formulating a domain adaptation problem from simulation to surgery. We provide a smaller number of datasets from real surgeries, and a larger number of annotated recordings of training and planning sessions from a physical mitral valve simulator.

However different algorithms use different methods for calculating TMB. Mutations in genes in tumor cells may lead to the creation of neoantigens, which have the potential to activate an immune system response against the tumor, and the likelihood of an immune system response may increase with the number of mutations. Thus, TMB is a biomarker for some immunotherapy drugs, called immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as those that target the PD-1 and PD-L1 pathways (Chan et al., 2019). An outstanding problem is the lack of standardization for TMB calculation and reporting between different assays. To address this problem, the Friends of Cancer Research convened a working group of industry and regulatory stakeholders to develop guidance and tools for TMB harmonization.

This process is exceedingly complex to model as a large number of parameters is needed to fully describe the process (see Rationale, de Boer et al. 2020; Zeitingler J. 2020). Understanding the cis-regulatory logic of the human genome is an important goal and would provide insight into the origins of many diseases.

As a consequence, computed protein structures are becoming much more widely used in a broadening range of applications. CASP has responded to this new landscape with a revised set of modeling categories. Some old categories have been dropped (refinement, contact prediction, and aspects of model accuracy estimation) and new ones have been added (RNA structures, protein ligand complexes, protein ensembles, and accuracy estimation for protein complexes). We are also strengthening our interactions with our partners CAPRI and CAMEO.

They were the first COVID-19 vaccines to start clinical trials (initially formulated in a matter of days) and the first to be approved and distributed. mRNA vaccines have the potential to transform immunization, being significantly faster to formulate and produce, cheaper, and more effective-including against mutant strains. However, there is one key bottleneck to their widespread viability and our ability to immunize the entire world-poor refrigerator stability in prefilled syringes.

This signature could form the basis for a fast, color-based test for TB, similar to an over-the-counter pregnancy test. What was needed was a sensor that could detect the concentrations of three RNAs, carry out the needed calculation, and report the result by binding another molecule. Over four rounds, players designed RNA sensors that can do the math on these 3 genes. Through experimental feedback, they honed their skills and techniques, which resulted in the creation of multiple designs that have been shown to be successful.

Stanford's Center for Personal Dynamic Regulomes and UC Berkeley's Innovative Genomics Institute have challenged Eterna players to solve a remaining hurdle in making this technology safe for use. Scientists want the power to turn on and off CRISPR on demand with small molecules. This is almost a perfect match to the small-molecule switches that the Eterna community has worked on. In fact, the MS2 RNA hairpin often used in Eterna is routinely used to recruit new functionality to CRISPR complexes through other molecules tethered to the MS2 protein.

They participate in gene regulation by influencing translation initiation or termination in mRNA molecules. Pseudoknots also play a role in programmed ribosomal frameshifting, leading to the production of different protein products from a single mRNA. RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and Dengue virus, utilize pseudoknots to regulate their replication and control the synthesis of viral proteins. Additionally, certain RNA molecules with pseudoknot structures exhibit enzymatic activity, acting as ribozymes and catalyzing biochemical reactions. These functions highlight the crucial role of RNA pseudoknots in gene expression, proteomic diversity, viral replication, and enzymatic processes. Several unanswered scientific questions surround RNA pseudoknots. One key area of inquiry is understanding the folding pathways of pseudoknots and how they form from linear RNA sequences.

Transcription is the process of decoding DNA genomic information into RNA, resulting in RNA transcripts. Genes are specific sequences of DNA that contain information to produce a specific RNA transcript. The fate of most mRNA molecules in the cell is to be translated by ribosomes into protein molecules. However, mRNA splicing is a crucial step that occurs between the formation of an RNA transcript and protein translation. This step is essential because genes contain non-protein coding introns and protein-coding exons. Splicing removes introns and joins exons to produce a mature mRNA molecule that can be decoded into the correct protein molecule. When the splicing process is corrupted due to genetic mutations, the resulting RNA can become toxic, leading to the synthesis of non-functional proteins or no protein at all, causing various human diseases...","","https://eternagame.org/challenges/11546273","active","13","","2023-02-20","\N","2023-08-08 18:43:25","2023-11-14 19:32:51"

The setting is lower limb arterial occlusive disease where imaging of the below knee arterial vasculature is critical in planning limb salvage interventions. However, the competing demands of the high spatial resolution needed to image small vessels versus imaging time constraints where there is often a very short arteriovenous transit time for contrast passage form arterial to venous compartments makes imaging challenging. While dynamic mra techniques can usually allow arterial imaging without venous ‚äòcontamination‚äô these necessarily sacrifice spatial resolution.","https://rumc-gcorg-p-public.s3.amazonaws.com/logos/challenge/243/paveslogo.png","https://paves.grand-challenge.org/","completed","5","","\N","\N","2023-11-08 00:42:00","2023-11-17 23:23:47"

The problem we want to solve is to classify each CT image into positive COVID-19 (the image has clinical findings of COVID-19) or negative COVID-19 ( the image does not have clinical findings of COVID-19).

Symptoms of lung cancer typically occur at an advanced stage of the disease, when treatment has a reduced chance of success. Early detection is therefore a key factor in reducing mortality rates from lung cancer. Pulmonary nodules, detected through imaging, are the initial manifestation of lung cancer, visible well before clinical symptoms or signs emerge. They can be visible on a chest radiograph (CXR), and chest radiography is by far the most common radiological exam in the world. Thus, CXR plays a critical role in the accurate identification of nodules in the drive towards early detection of lung cancer.

The goal of planning is to ensure the cancer cells receive enough radiation and to prevent normal cells in organs-at-risk (OARs) from being damaged too much. For instance, optical nerves and chiasma in the head cannot receive too much radiation. Otherwise, the patient risks losing his/her vision. Gross Target Volume (GTV) is the position and extent of gross tumor imaged by CT scans, i.e., what can be seen. A critical step in radiation treatment planning is to delineate the boundaries of GTV and tens of OARs.

Using passive, automated monitoring, the ultimate goal is to look out for a person's well-being without being burdensome or intrusive.  To gather data, researchers in the SPHERE Inter-disciplinary Research Collaboration (IRC) equipped volunteers with accelerometers similar to those found in cell phones or fitness wearables, and then had the subjects go about normal activities of daily living in a home-like environment that was also equipped with motion detectors. After gathering a robust set of sensor data, they had multiple annotators use camera footage to establish the ground truth, labeling chunks of sensor data as one of twenty specifically chosen activities (e.g. walk, sit, stand-to-bend, ascend stairs, descend stairs, etc).  Your challenge: help push forward the state of the art by pred...","","https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/42/senior-data-science-safe-aging-with-sphere/","completed","19","","\N","2016-07-31","2023-12-06 08:35:31","2023-12-06 8:44:36"

Latent variable models (LVMs) are promising tools for analyzing this rich activity across diverse neural systems and behaviors, as LVMs do not depend on known relationships between the activity and external experimental variables. To coordinate LVM modeling efforts, we introduce the Neural Latents Benchmark (NLB). The first benchmark suite, NLB 2021, evaluates models on 7 datasets of neural spiking activity spanning 4 tasks and brain areas.","https://neurallatents.github.io/logo.svg","https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1256/overview","completed","16","","\N","2022-04-03","2023-12-12 18:31:00","2023-12-12 22:39:42"
"478","brain-to-text-benchmark-24","Brain-to-Text Benchmark '24","Develop new and improved algorithms for decoding speech from the brain","People with ALS or brainstem stroke can lose the ability to move, rendering them “locked-in” their own bodies and unable to communicate. Speech brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can restore communication by decoding what someone is trying to say directly from their brain activity. Once deciphered, the person’s intended message can be spoken for them or typed as text on a computer.  We recently showed that a speech BCI can decode speech at 62 words per minute with a 23% word error rate, demonstrating the potential of a high-performance speech BCI. Nevertheless, word error rates are not yet low enough for fluent communication.  The goal of this competition is to foster the development of new and improved algorithms for decoding speech from the brain. Improved accuracies will make it more likely that a speech BCI can be clinically translated, improving the lives of those with paralysis. We hope that this baseline can also serve as an indicator of progress in the field and provide a st...","https://evalai.s3.amazonaws.com/media/logos/35b2c474-c1be-41ae-97a4-49446766f9b1.png","https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/2099/overview","active","16","","2023-06-01","2024-06-01","2023-12-12 21:54:25","2023-12-12 22:38:33"

Given that different people can provide different answers to a visual question, we aim to better understand why with answer groundings. To achieve this goal, we introduce the VQA-AnswerTherapy dataset, the first dataset that visually grounds each unique answer to each visual question. We offer this work as a valuable foundation for improving our understanding and handling of annotator differences. This work can inform how to account for annotator differences for other related tasks such as image captioning, visual dialog, and open-domain VQA (e.g., VQAs found on Yahoo!Answers and Stack Exchange). This work also contributes to ethical AI by enabling revisiting how VQA models are developed and evaluated to consider the diversity of plausible answer groundings rather than a single (typically majority) one.","https://evalai.s3.amazonaws.com/media/logos/e63bc0a0-cd35-4418-b32b-4ef2b9c61ce2.png","https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1910/overview","upcoming","16","","2024-01-30","\N","2023-12-12 22:41:48","2023-12-12 23:20:41"
