Typically emerging around age 50, it affects about five in 100,000 people worldwide, with familial hereditary forms as the only known risk factors (5-10% of cases).  There is currently no cure for ALS. The FDA-approved drug Riluzole extends life by a few months. ALS patients, on average, have a life expectancy of 2-5 years, with 10% experiencing slower disease progression. Astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, living with ALS for 49 years, is an exceptional case.

Human cancer cell lines represent a good model to help identify associations between molecular subtypes, pathways, and drug response. In recent years there have been several efforts to generate genomic profiles of collections of cell lines and to determine their response to panels of candidate therapeutic compounds. These data provide the basis for the development of in silico models of sensitivity based either on the unperturbed genetic potential of a cancer cell, or by using perturbation data to incorporate knowledge of actual cell response. Making predictions from either of these data profiles will be beneficial in identifying single and combinatorial chemotherapeutic response in patients.

The primary goal is to encourage stakeholders, including technology providers, public health advocates, entrepreneurs, and innovators from all disciplines and around the world, to develop traceability hardware, software, or data analytics platforms that are low-cost or no-cost to the en...","","https://precision.fda.gov/challenges/13","completed","6","","2021-06-01","2021-07-30","\N","2023-06-23 00:00:00","2023-10-17 23:05:49"
"92","tumor-mutational-burden-tmb-challenge-phase-1","Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) Challenge Phase 1","Standardize tumor mutational burden (TMB) calculation in cancer research","Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is generally defined as the number of mutations detected in a patient's tumor sample per megabase of DNA sequenced. However different algorithms use different methods for calculating TMB. Mutations in genes in tumor cells may lead to the creation of neoantigens, which have the potential to activate an immune system response against the tumor, and the likelihood of an immune system response may increase with the number of mutations. Thus, TMB is a biomarker for some immunotherapy drugs, called immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as those that target the PD-1 and PD-L1 pathways (Chan et al., 2019).  An outstanding problem is the lack of standardization for TMB calculation and reporting between different assays. To address this problem, the Friends of Cancer Research convened a working group of industry and regulatory stakeholders to develop guidance and tools for TMB harmonization. Results from the first phase of this effort were presented at AACR 2020 (...","","https://precision.fda.gov/challenges/17","completed","6","","2021-06-21","2021-09-13","\N","2023-06-23 00:00:00","2023-11-02 18:28:46"
"93","kits21","KiTS21","Contest seeks best kidney tumor segmentation system","The 2021 Kidney and Kidney Tumor Segmentation challenge (abbreviated KiTS21) is a competition in which teams compete to develop the best system for automatic semantic segmentation of renal tumors and surrounding anatomy. Kidney cancer is one of the most common malignancies in adults around the world, and its incidence is thought to be increasing [1]. Fortunately, most kidney tumors are discovered early while they're still localized and operable. However, there are important questions concerning management of localized kidney tumors that remain unanswered [2], and metastatic renal cancer remains almost uniformly fatal [3]. Kidney tumors are notorious for their conspicuous appearance in computed tomography (CT) imaging, and this has enabled important work by radiologists and surgeons to study the relationship between tumor size, shape, and appearance and its prospects for treatment [4,5,6]. It's laborious work, however, and it relies on assessments that are often subjective and impr...","https://rumc-gcorg-p-public.s3.amazonaws.com/logos/challenge/594/rendering_dimmed.png","https://kits21.grand-challenge.org/","completed","5","","2021-08-23","2021-09-17","\N","2023-06-23 00:00:00","2023-11-28 00:32:11"
"94","realnoisemri","RealNoiseMRI","Brain MRI reconstruction challenge with realistic noise","In recent years, there is a growing focus on the application of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on prior knowledge. In the 1980s and 2000s the community used either purely mathematical models such as the partial Fourier transform or solutions derived through advanced engineering such as parallel imaging to speed up MRI acquisition. Since the mid-2000's, compressed sensing and artificial intelligence have been employed to speed up MRI acquisition. These newer methods rely on under sampling the data acquired in Fourier (aka k-) space and then interpolating or augmenting k-space data based on training data content. One of the underlying problems for the development of fast imaging techniques, that just as in e.g. [1], it is common to use a fully sampled image as ground truth and then under sample it in k-space in order to simulate under sampled data. The problem with this approach is that in cases were the under sampled data is corrupted, through e.g. motion, this under s...","https://rumc-gcorg-p-public.s3.amazonaws.com/logos/challenge/597/Logo_Challenge.png","https://realnoisemri.grand-challenge.org/","completed","5","","2023-07-15","2028-09-20","\N","2023-06-23 00:00:00","2024-04-29 18:57:37"

Mitral valve repair, although considerably more difficult, is prefered over mitral valve replacement, since the native tissue of the valve is preserved. It is a complex on-pump heart surgery, often conducted only by a handful of surgeons in high-volume centers. Minimally invasive procedures, which are performed with endoscopic video recordings, became more and more popular in recent years. However, data availability and data privacy concerns are still an issue for the development of automatic scene analysis algorithms. The AdaptOR challenge aims to address these issues by formulating a domain adaptation problem from simulation to surgery. We provide a smaller number of datasets from real surgeries, and a larger number of annotated recordings of training and planning sessions from a physical mitral valve simulator.

However different algorithms use different methods for calculating TMB. Mutations in genes in tumor cells may lead to the creation of neoantigens, which have the potential to activate an immune system response against the tumor, and the likelihood of an immune system response may increase with the number of mutations. Thus, TMB is a biomarker for some immunotherapy drugs, called immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as those that target the PD-1 and PD-L1 pathways (Chan et al., 2019). An outstanding problem is the lack of standardization for TMB calculation and reporting between different assays. To address this problem, the Friends of Cancer Research convened a working group of industry and regulatory stakeholders to develop guidance and tools for TMB harmonization.

This process is exceedingly complex to model as a large number of parameters is needed to fully describe the process (see Rationale, de Boer et al. 2020; Zeitingler J. 2020). Understanding the cis-regulatory logic of the human genome is an important goal and would provide insight into the origins of many diseases.

As a consequence, computed protein structures are becoming much more widely used in a broadening range of applications. CASP has responded to this new landscape with a revised set of modeling categories. Some old categories have been dropped (refinement, contact prediction, and aspects of model accuracy estimation) and new ones have been added (RNA structures, protein ligand complexes, protein ensembles, and accuracy estimation for protein complexes).

What was needed was a sensor that could detect the concentrations of three RNAs, carry out the needed calculation, and report the result by binding another molecule. Over four rounds, players designed RNA sensors that can do the math on these 3 genes.

Stanford's Center for Personal Dynamic Regulomes and UC Berkeley's Innovative Genomics Institute have challenged Eterna players to solve a remaining hurdle in making this technology safe for use. Scientists want the power to turn on and off CRISPR on demand with small molecules. This is almost a perfect match to the small-molecule switches that the Eterna community has worked on.

Pseudoknots also play a role in programmed ribosomal frameshifting, leading to the production of different protein products from a single mRNA. RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and Dengue virus, utilize pseudoknots to regulate their replication and control the synthesis of viral proteins. Additionally, certain RNA molecules with pseudoknot structures exhibit enzymatic activity, acting as ribozymes and catalyzing biochemical reactions. These functions highlight the crucial role of RNA pseudoknots in gene expression, proteomic diversity, viral replication, and enzymatic processes.

Transcription is the process of decoding DNA genomic information into RNA, resulting in RNA transcripts. Genes are specific sequences of DNA that contain information to produce a specific RNA transcript. The fate of most mRNA molecules in the cell is to be translated by ribosomes into protein molecules. However, mRNA splicing is a crucial step that occurs between the formation of an RNA transcript and protein translation. This step is essential because genes contain non-protein coding introns and protein-coding exons. Splicing removes introns and joins exons to produce a mature mRNA molecule that can be decoded into the correct protein molecule. When the splicing process is corrupted due to genetic mutations, the resulting RNA can become toxic, leading to the synthesis of non-functional proteins or no protein at all, causing various human diseases...","","https://eternagame.org/challenges/11546273","active","13","","2023-02-20","\N","\N","2023-08-08 18:43:25","2023-11-14 19:32:51"

"307","curious2018","CuRIOUS 2018","MICCAI Challenge 2018 for brainshift correction with intra-operative ultrasound","Early brain tumor resection can effectively improve the patient''s survival rate. However, resection quality and safety can often be heavily affected by intra-operative brain tissue shift due to factors, such as gravity, drug administration, intracranial pressure change, and tissue removal. Such tissue shift can displace the surgical target and vital structures (e.g., blood vessels) shown in pre-operative images while these displacements may not be directly visible in the surgeon''s field of view.  Intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) is a robust and relatively inexpensive technique to track intra-operative tissue shift and surgical tools, but to help update pre-surgical plans with this information, accurate and robust image registration algorithms are needed to relate pre-surgical MRI to iUS images. Despite the great progress so far, medical image registration techniques still have not made into the surgical room to directly benefit the patients with brain tumors.

Pulmonary nodules, detected through imaging, are the initial manifestation of lung cancer, visible well before clinical symptoms or signs emerge. They can be visible on a chest radiograph (CXR), and chest radiography is by far the most common radiological exam in the world. Thus, CXR plays a critical role in the accurate identification of nodules in the drive towards early detection of lung cancer.

For a given test set of TCR-epitope pairs, the task of the model is to identify which pairs will bind and which will not bind.","","https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tcr-specificity-prediction-challenge","completed","8","","2023-10-31","2023-12-11","2242","2024-11-20 16:02:13","2024-12-03 1:32:04"

The task of FGIA targets analyzing visual objects from subordinate categories, e.g., species of birds or models of cars. The small inter-class and large intra-class variations inherent to fine-grained image analysis make it a challenging problem.  Fine-grained image retrieval, as a crucial research area of FGIA, aims to retrieve images belonging to multiple subordinate categories of a super-category (aka a meta-category). Its key challenge therefore lies in understanding fine-grained visual differences that sufficiently distinguish objects that are highly similar in overall appearance, but differ in fine-grained features. Also, fine-grained retrieval still demands ranking all the instances so that images depicting the concept of interest are ranked highest based on the fine-grained details in the query.

Misidentification of mushrooms can lead to health risks, including poisoning. By developing a reliable image classification model using this dataset, we aim to provide a tool that helps individuals accurately identify mushrooms, enhancing safety and promoting knowledge about local biodiversity.  Dataset The Estonian Mushroom Image Classification Dataset is a new collection of images representing the most popular mushroom species found in Estonia. It is structured into ten classes, each corresponding to a specific mushroom species, with annotations regarding their edibility status. The dataset consists of 300 images per class, totaling 3000 images.","","https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mushroom-multiclass-classification","completed","8","","2024-04-14","2024-05-11","2869","2024-11-25 22:39:26","2024-11-25 22:51:37"

However, recent advances in single-cell technologies have provided unparalleled insight into the function of cells and tissues at the level of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Yet leveraging single-cell methods to develop medicines requires mapping causal links between chemical perturbations and the downstream impact on cell state. These experiments are costly and labor intensive, and not all cells and tissues are amenable to high-throughput transcriptomic screening. If data science could help accurately predict chemical perturbations in new cell types, it could accelerate and expand the development of new medicines.  Several methods have been developed for drug perturbation prediction, most of which are variations on the autoencoder architecture (Dr.VAE, scGEN, and ChemCPA). However, these methods lack proper benchmar...","","https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/open-problems-single-cell-perturbations","completed","8","","2023-09-12","2023-11-30","\N","2024-11-25 22:45:56","2024-12-09 19:45:48"

As of today, we are aware of over 5,600 exoplanets. Detecting these worlds is the initial step; we must also comprehend and characterise their nature by studying their atmospheres. In 2029, ESA Ariel Mission will conduct the first comprehensive study of 1,000 extrasolar planets in our galactic neighbourhood.  Observing these atmospheres is one of the hardest data-analysis problems in contemporary astronomy. When an exoplanet transits its host star in our line of sight, a tiny fraction of starlight (50–200 photons per million) passes through the planet's atmospheric annulus and interacts with its chemistry, clouds, and winds. These faint signals typically range from 50ppm (for Super-Earth like planets) to 200ppm (for Jupiter like planets) in magnitude and are regularly corrupted ...","","https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ariel-data-challenge-2024","completed","8","","2024-08-01","2024-10-31","2648","2024-12-09 16:34:01","2024-12-09 19:45:56"

Most people experience low back pain at some point in their lives, with the frequency increasing with age. Pain and restricted mobility are often symptoms of spondylosis, a set of degenerative spine conditions including degeneration of intervertebral discs and subsequent narrowing of the spinal canal (spinal stenosis), subarticular recesses, or neural foramen with associated compression or irritations of the nerves in the low back.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a detailed view of the lumbar spine vertebra, discs and nerves, enabling radiologists to assess the presence and severity of these conditions.

Because of the complexity of Earth''s climate, these models rely on parameterizations to approximate the effects of physical processes that occur at scales smaller than the size of their grid cells. These approximations are imperfect, however, and their imperfections are a leading source of uncertainty in expected warming, changing precipitation patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme events. The Multi-scale Modeling Framework (MMF) approach, by contrast, more explicitly represents these subgrid processes, but at a cost too high to be used for operational climate prediction.  Your task is to develop ML models that emulate subgrid atmospheric processes–such as storms, clouds, turbulence, rainfall, and radiation–within E3SM-MMF, a multi-scale climate model backed by the U.S. Department of Energy.
