"3","phil-bowen-als-prediction-prize4life","Phil Bowen ALS Prediction Prize4Life","","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)–also known as Lou Gehrig's disease (in the US) or Motor Neurone disease (outside the US)–is a fatal neurological disease causing death of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord which control voluntary muscle movements. This leaves patients struggling with a progressive loss of motor function while leaving cognitive functions intact. Symptoms usually do not manifest until the age of 50 but can start earlier. At any given time, approximately five out of every 100,000 people worldwide suffer from ALS, though there would be a higher prevalence if the disease did not progress so rapidly, leading to the death of the patient.    There are no known risk factors for developing ALS other than having a family member who has a hereditary form of the disease, which accounts for about 5-10% of ALS patients. There is also no known cure for ALS. The only FDA-approved drug for the disease is Riluzole, which has been shown to prolong the life span of someon...","","https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2826267","completed","intermediate","1","","2012-06-01","2012-10-01","2023-06-23 00:00:00","2023-09-28 18:32:11"

Human cancer cell lines represent a good model to help identify associations between molecular subtypes, pathways, and drug response. In recent years there have been several efforts to generate genomic profiles of collections of cell lines and to determine their response to panels of candidate therapeutic compounds. These data provide the basis for the development of in silico models of sensitivity based either on the unperturbed genetic potential of a cancer cell, or by using perturbation data to incorporate knowledge of actual cell response. Making predictions from either of these data profiles will be beneficial in identifying single and combinatorial chemotherapeutic response in patients. To that end, the present challenge seeks computational methods, derived from the molecular profiling of cell lines both in a static state and in response to perturbation of ...","","https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2785778","completed","intermediate","1","","2012-06-01","2012-10-01","2023-06-23 00:00:00","2023-09-28 20:57:05"

A library of thousands of PTEN and TPMT mutations was assessed to measure the stability of the variant protein using a multiplexed variant stability profiling (VSP) assay, which detects the presence of EGFP fused to the mutated PTEN and TPMT protein respectively. The stability of the variant protein dictates the abundance of the fusion protein and thus the EGFP level of the cell.

Mutations in genes in tumor cells may lead to the creation of neoantigens, which have the potential to activate an immune system response against the tumor, and the likelihood of an immune system response may increase with the number of mutations. Thus, TMB is a biomarker for some immunotherapy drugs, called immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as those that target the PD-1 and PD-L1 pathways (Chan et al., 2019).

To tackle these limitations, the crossMoDA challenge introduces the first large and multi-class dataset for unsupervised cross-modality Domain Adaptation.","","https://crossmoda-challenge.ml/","completed","advanced","5","","2021-04-05","2021-09-27","2023-06-23 00:00:00","2023-09-28 22:02:11"
"95","real-noise-mri","Real Noise MRI","","In recent years, there is a growing focus on the application of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on prior knowledge. In the 1980s and 2000s the community used either purely mathematical models such as the partial Fourier transform or solutions derived through advanced engineering such as parallel imaging to speed up MRI acquisition. Since the mid-2000's, compressed sensing and artificial intelligence have been employed to speed up MRI acquisition. These newer methods rely on under sampling the data acquired in Fourier (aka k-) space and then interpolating or augmenting k-space data based on training data content. One of the underlying problems for the development of fast imaging techniques, that just as in e.g. [1], it is common to use a fully sampled image as ground truth and then under sample it in k-space in order to simulate under sampled data. The problem with this approach is that in cases were the under sampled data is corrupted, through e.g. motion, this under s...","","https://realnoisemri.grand-challenge.org/Description/","completed","intermediate","5","","2021-09-21","2021-12-06","2023-06-23 00:00:00","2023-09-28 22:02:24"
"96","deep-generative-model-challenge-for-da-in-surgery","Deep Generative Model Challenge for DA in Surgery","","Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the second most frequent indication for valve surgery in Europe and may occur for organic or functional causes [1]. Mitral valve repair, although considerably more difficult, is prefered over mitral valve replacement, since the native tissue of the valve is preserved. It is a complex on-pump heart surgery, often conducted only by a handful of surgeons in high-volume centers. Minimally invasive procedures, which are performed with endoscopic video recordings, became more and more popular in recent years. However, data availability and data privacy concerns are still an issue for the development of automatic scene analysis algorithms. The AdaptOR challenge aims to address these issues by formulating a domain adaptation problem from simulation to surgery. We provide a smaller number of datasets from real surgeries, and a larger number of annotated recordings of training and planning sessions from a physical mitral valve simulator. The goal is to reduce th...","","https://adaptor2021.github.io/","completed","intermediate","1","","2021-04-01","2021-07-16","2023-06-23 00:00:00","2023-09-28 22:03:01"

"146","biocreative-vii-text-mining-drug-and-chemical-protein-interactions-drugprot","BioCreative VII: Text mining drug and chemical-protein interactions (DrugProt)","","With the rapid accumulation of biomedical literature, it is getting increasingly challenging to exploit efficiently drug-related information described in the scientific literature. One of the most relevant aspects of drugs and chemical compounds are their relationships with certain biomedical entities, in particular genes and proteins.

However different algorithms use different methods for calculating TMB. Mutations in genes in tumor cells may lead to the creation of neoantigens, which have the potential to activate an immune system response against the tumor, and the likelihood of an immune system response may increase with the number of mutations. Thus, TMB is a biomarker for some immunotherapy drugs, called immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as those that target the PD-1 and PD-L1 pathways (Chan et al., 2019).  An outstanding problem is the lack of standardization for TMB calculation and reporting between different assays. To address this problem, the Friends of Cancer Research convened a working group of industry and regulatory stakeholders to develop guidance and tools for TMB harmonization.

Regulatory DNA is decoded by the cell in a process termed “cis-regulatory logic”, where proteins called Transcription Factors (TFs) bind to specific DNA sequences within the genome and work together to produce as output a level of gene expression for downstream adjacent genes. This process is exceedingly complex to model as a large number of parameters is needed to fully describe the process (see Rationale, de Boer et al. 2020; Zeitingler J. 2020).  Understanding the cis-regulatory logic of the human genome is an important goal and would provide insight into the origins of many diseases.

They were the first COVID-19 vaccines to start clinical trials (initially formulated in a matter of days) and the first to be approved and distributed. mRNA vaccines have the potential to transform immunization, being significantly faster to formulate and produce, cheaper, and more effective - including against mutant strains. However, there is one key bottleneck to their widespread viability and our ability to immunize the entire world: poor refrigerator stability in prefilled syringes. The OpenVaccine challenge aims to allow a worldwide community of game players to create an enhanced vaccine to be injected into millions of people. The challenge: design an mRNA that codes for the same amino acid sequence of the spike protein, but is 2x-10x+ more stable.

This signature could form the basis for a fast, color-based test for TB, similar to an over-the-counter pregnancy test. What was needed was a sensor that could detect the concentrations of three RNAs, carry out the needed calculation, and report the result by binding another molecule. Over four rounds, players designed RNA sensors that can do the math on these 3 genes. Through experimental feedback, they honed their skills and techniques, which resulted in the creation of multiple designs that have been shown to be successful. These findings are being prepared to be published, and future work will be done to develop diagnostic devices integrating these designs","","https://eternagame.org/challenges/10845742","completed","intermediate","13","","2016-05-04","2018-04-15","2023-08-08 18:43:09","2023-09-28 23:17:09"

Scientists want the power to turn on and off CRISPR on demand with small molecules. This is almost a perfect match to the small-molecule switches that the Eterna community has worked on. In fact, the MS2 RNA hairpin often used in Eterna is routinely used to recruit new functionality to CRISPR complexes through other molecules tethered to the MS2 protein.

RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and Dengue virus, utilize pseudoknots to regulate their replication and control the synthesis of viral proteins. Additionally, certain RNA molecules with pseudoknot structures exhibit enzymatic activity, acting as ribozymes and catalyzing biochemical reactions. These functions highlight the crucial role of RNA pseudoknots in gene expression, proteomic diversity, viral replication, and enzymatic processes.

Transcription is the process of decoding DNA genomic information into RNA, resulting in RNA transcripts. Genes are specific sequences of DNA that contain information to produce a specific RNA transcript. The fate of most mRNA molecules in the cell is to be translated by ribosomes into protein molecules. However, mRNA splicing is a crucial step that occurs between the formation of an RNA transcript and protein translation. This step is essential because genes contain non-protein coding introns and protein-coding exons. Splicing removes introns and joins exons to produce a mature mRNA molecule that can be decoded into the correct protein molecule.  When the splicing process is corrupted due to genetic mutations, the resulting RNA can become toxic, leading to the synthesis of non-functional proteins or no protein at all, causing various human disease...","","https://eternagame.org/challenges/11546273","active","intermediate","13","","2023-02-20","\N","2023-08-08 18:43:25","2023-09-28 23:17:27"

These antibodies are capable to bind to a variety of structures ranging from small molecules to protein complexes, including any posttranslational modification thereof. When studying protein-antibody interactions, two types of epitopes (the region paratopes interact with) are to be distinguished from each other: i) conformational and ii) linear epitopes. All potential linear epitopes of a protein can be represented by short peptides derived from the primary amino acid sequence. These peptides can be synthesized and arrayed on solid supports, e.g. glass slides (see Lorenz et al., 2009 [1]).

One obstacle in the field is obtaining accurate measurements of transcription derived by different promoters. To address this, an experimental system was designed to measure the transcription derived by different promoters, all of which are inserted into the same genomic location upstream to a reporter gene – a yellow florescence protein gene (YFP). The challenge consists of the prediction of the promoter activity given a promoter sequence and a specific experimental condition.

For the past several years, the group of Rick Lathrop at University of California, Irvine, has been engaged in a complete functional census of p53 second-site suppressor (“cancer rescue”) mutations. These cancer rescue mutations are additional amino acids changes (to otherwise cancerous p53 mutations), which have been found to rescue p53 tumor suppressor function, reactivating otherwise inactive p53.

The challenge is to predict the functional effects of these variants in two different settings: (1) for the wildtype protein, and (2) for the protein with the common Ala222Val variant.","","https://genomeinterpretation.org/cagi6-mthfr.html","completed","intermediate","1","","2021-05-03","2021-06-30","2023-06-23 00:00:00","2023-09-27 18:56:19"

The study is led by genomics experts and clinicians at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Research subjects are consented for genomic sequencing and the sharing of their sequence and phenotype information with researchers working to understand the molecular causes of rare disease. When a candidate disease variant believed to be related to the phenotype is identified, the variant is confirmed with Sanger sequencing in a clinical setting and returned to the participant via his or her local physician. In this challenge, whole genome sequence data and phenotype data from a subset of the solved and unsolved RGP families will be provided. Participants in the challenge will try to identify the causative variant(s) in each case. For the unsolved cases, prioritized variants from the participating teams will be examined to see if ad...","","https://genomeinterpretation.org/cagi6-rgp.html","completed","intermediate","1","","2021-06-08","2021-10-11","2023-06-23 00:00:00","2023-09-29 10:30:26"

Germline variants resulting in loss of STK11 define Peutz-Jaghers Syndrome, an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome marked by gastrointestinal hamartomas and freckling of the oral mucosa. Somatic loss of function variants, both nonsense and missense, occur in 15-30% of non-small cell lung adenocarcinomas, where they correlate clinically with insensitivity to anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody therapy.
