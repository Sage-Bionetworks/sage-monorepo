    'The Critical Assessment of protein Function Annotation algorithms (CAFA) is an experiment designed to assess the performance of computational methods dedicated to predicting protein function, often using a time challenge. Briefly, CAFA organizers provide a large number of unannotated or incompletely annotated protein sequences. The predictors then predict the function of these proteins by associating them with Gene Ontology terms or Human Phenoytpe Ontology terms. Following the prediction deadline, there is a wait period of several months during which some proteins whose functions were unknown will receive experimental verification. Those proteins constitute the benchmark set, against which the methods are tested. Other data sources include experiments by wet lab collaborators and biocuration dedicated to CAFA.',
