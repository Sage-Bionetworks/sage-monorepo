# OpenChallenges Thumbor

## Usage

### Prepare the service

```console
nx prepare openchallenges-thumbor
```

### Start Thumbor and MinIO

```console
nx serve-detach openchallenges-thumbor
```

### Upload an image to MinIO

1. Open MinIO web console http://localhost:9001/.
2. Login into MinIO (see MinIO project folder for the default credentials).
3. Upload an image to the bucket `img`
    - E.g. Download the [Triforce image] and name it `triforce.png`.

### Access the image with Thumbor

Open this link and you should see the resized image:

- http://localhost:8889/unsafe/600x600/triforce.png

Open this ling when the API Gateway is running:

- http://localhost:8082/img/unsafe/triforce.png

## Using Amazon S3 buckets as object storage

### Create the buckets

We need two buckets, one to store the original images and one to store the images generated by
Thumbor (result images).

- `openchallenges-img`
- `openchallenges-img-cache`

### Add the sample image

In the bucket `openchallenges-img`, create the folder `img` and add the [Triforce image] to it.

### Create Thumbor IAM user

Create the IAM user `openchallenges-thumbor` and create an access key for this user.

Assign the following policy to this user so that Thumbor. This gives Thumbor read access to the
bucket that stores the original images and read-write access to the bucket that stores the result
images.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetObject*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::openchallenges-img",
        "arn:aws:s3:::openchallenges-img/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::openchallenges-img-cache",
        "arn:aws:s3:::openchallenges-img-cache/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*Object",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::openchallenges-img-cache/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Update Thumbor config

Replace the file `.env` with a copy of `.env.example.aws`. Replace the access key properties with
the values stored in LastPass.

## Notes

- By default, Thumbor starts as many processes as the number of cores available.
