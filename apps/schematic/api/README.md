# OpenAPI generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from folder `apps/schematic/api`:
```
poetry shell
```
To install dependencies: 

```
poetry install 
```
And run schematic APIs: 

```
python3 -m schematic-api
```
and open your browser to here:

```
http://127.0.0.1:7080/api/v1/ui/
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# Get the correct Python version
nx prepare schematic-api

# You only need to run this command one time
# This step adds SSL private key and certificate as environment variable in .env file
python3 apps/schematic/api/prepare_key_certificate.py

# building the image
nx build-image schematic-api

# starting up a container
nx serve-detach schematic-api
```
