 * Basic test class for DatasetServiceApplication.
 *
 * For a production application, you would typically want more comprehensive tests.
 * This basic test ensures the application class can be instantiated.
 *
 * To add Spring Boot integration tests, you would need to:
 * 1. Configure test properties to use H2 database
 * 2. Disable Hibernate Search and Elasticsearch in tests
 * 3. Set up test data fixtures
 * 4. Test actual service functionality
