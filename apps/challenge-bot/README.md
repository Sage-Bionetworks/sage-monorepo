# Challenge Bot

This GitHub App automates tasks in this repository.

## Preparation

```console
nx prepare challenge-bot
```

## Deploying to AWS

1. Create an IAM user named `challenge-bot` (deployment user).
    - Store the access key ID and secret access key in a secure place.

2. Assign [this policy](docs/challenge-bot-dev-us-east-1-policy.json) to the deployment user.
    - Replace the string `ACCOUNT` by your AWS account ID (e.g. `123456789012`).
    - This policy has been generated with the [Serverless policy generator], which has then been
      manually updated to successfully deploy the app.

3. Configure your AWS profile with the credentials you received by running this command in your
   terminal. This [guide] provides alternate methods to use AWS credentials.

    ```console
    serverless config credentials \
      --provider aws \
      --key <access key ID> \
      --secret <secret access key>
    ```

4. In your AWS parameter store, create and store values for the environment variables used in
   `serverless.yml` that are prefixed with `ssm:/` (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

5. Deploy the app.

    ```console
      nx deploy challenge-bot
    ```
