          The Challenge experience is currently cumbersome for all stakeholders involved.
          Participants encounter a huge pain-point in discovering Challenges they are interested in,
          while Organizers struggle to find a streamlined solution to reaching a wide audience.

        <p>
          OpenChallenges (OC) strives to address some of the friction in the Challenge experience by
          providing a centralized hub to reduce participant search cost and increasing Challenge
          visibility. Think of OpenChallenges like an EventBrite for the scientific benchmarking
          space!

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Sage Bionetworks strives to bridge the translational divide between biomedical research
          and clinical application by embracing open and reusable practices. One example is hosting
          scientific Challenges, galvanizing large communities of experts around new and complex
          biomedical problems. Aside from crowdsourcing biomedical problems, Challenges also seek to
          enable the robust assessment of tool performance (Ellrott, K., Buchanan, A., Creason, A.
          et al.)
        </p>
        <p>
          When done right, Challenges encourage innovation by promoting friendly competition to
          develop the best algorithms, evaluation with objective frameworks for assessment of these
          algorithms, and collaboration by bringing together new teams to uncover new insights. The
          Challenges ecosystem, however, is bottlenecked by the lack of a hub centralizing all
          biomedical challenges. Participants encounter a huge pain-point in discovering Challenges
          they are interested in, while Organizers struggle to find a streamlined solution to
          reaching a wide audience.
