# Redocly configuration file for OpenChallenges API
#
# About `x-audience`:
# - The optional `x-audience` annotation can be applied to OpenAPI nodes such as tags, paths,
#   components, and others.
# - When using decorators like `filter-in` or `filter-out`, only nodes annotated with `x-audience`
#   are evaluated for inclusion or exclusion.
# - Nodes without an `x-audience` annotation are not affected by these filters and will always be
#   included in the output OpenAPI files.
# - This allows you to selectively expose or hide parts of your API for different audiences, while
#   keeping unannotated nodes visible in all outputs.
# - Best practice: Be intentional and always specify the `x-audience` annotation on nodes.
