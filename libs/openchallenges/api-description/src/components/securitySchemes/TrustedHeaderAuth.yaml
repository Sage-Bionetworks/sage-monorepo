description: >
  Authentication via trusted headers set by the API Gateway.
  The API Gateway validates JWT tokens or API keys and forwards authenticated
  user information to downstream services via trusted headers:
  - X-Authenticated-User-Id: The authenticated user's ID
  - X-Authenticated-User: The authenticated user's username  
  - X-Authenticated-Roles: The authenticated user's roles
  - X-Scopes: OAuth2 scopes (if applicable)

  This security scheme is used when services are deployed behind the API Gateway
  and trust the authentication headers it provides.
