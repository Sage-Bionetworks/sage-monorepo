          <h2>Proteomics</h2>
          <p>
            Proteomic analyses of post-mortem brains show whether protein products of
            {{ _gene.hgnc_symbol || _gene.ensembl_gene_id }} are differentially expressed between AD
            cases and controls. Each box plot depicts how the differential expression of the
            protein(s) of interest (purple dot) compares with expression of other proteins in a
            given brain region. Summary statistics for each tissue can be viewed by hovering over
            the purple dots.
