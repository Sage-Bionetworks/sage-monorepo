            <h3>About AD Risk Scores</h3>
            <p>
              The TREAT-AD Center at Emory-Sage-SGC has developed a Target Risk Score (TRS) to
              objectively rank the potential involvement of specific genes in AD. The TRS is derived
              by summing two component risk scores, the Genetic Risk Score and the Multi-omic Risk
              Score, each of which is derived from a meta-analysis of multiple harmonized data sets.
              More information about the methodology used to define these risk scores is available

            <h3>AD Risk Scores for {{ gene.hgnc_symbol || gene.ensembl_gene_id }}</h3>
            <p>
              The TRS for {{ gene.hgnc_symbol || gene.ensembl_gene_id }}, along with the component
              Genetic and Multi-omic Risk Scores, is shown here. The scores for
              {{ gene.hgnc_symbol || gene.ensembl_gene_id }} are superimposed on the genome-wide
              score distributions. If <i>No Data is Currently Available</i> is displayed for a
              score, that score was not calculated for
              {{ gene.hgnc_symbol || gene.ensembl_gene_id }}.

            <h3>About Biological Domains</h3>
            <p>
              A biological domain represents a standardized area of biology defined by a set of
              discrete, biologically coherent GO terms. The TREAT-AD Center at Emory-Sage-SGC has
              defined nineteen biological domains associated with AD, and objectively mapped genes
              to those biological domains using GO term annotations. More information about the
              methodology used to define AD biological domains, and to generate genome-wide
              biological domain mappings, is available

            <p>
              Select a biological domain on the left to see the list of GO terms that link
              {{ gene.hgnc_symbol || gene.ensembl_gene_id }} to it on the right. The percentage
              value displayed next to the currently selected biological domain indicates the
              proportion of {{ gene.hgnc_symbol || gene.ensembl_gene_id }}'s total unique GO terms
              that map to the biological domain. The ratio displayed on the right indicates how many
              of the biological domain's total GO terms
              {{ gene.hgnc_symbol || gene.ensembl_gene_id }} is annotated with.
