# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

`libs/agora/` is a collection of Angular libraries for Agora, a Sage Bionetworks tool for exploring Alzheimer's disease gene evidence.

## Commands

```bash
nx test agora-<lib-name>   # run unit tests for a lib
nx lint agora-<lib-name>   # lint a lib
```

For serving the Agora app, see the "Serving an App" section in the root `CLAUDE.md` — the full stack must be running first.

## Dependency Layers

Libraries depend only downward:

```
Feature components (genes, home, teams, nomination-form, *-comparison-tool)
         ↓
   charts / ui
         ↓
   services / util / config
         ↓
  api-client-angular  (generated from api-description)
         ↓
  testing / styles / assets  (infrastructure)
```

All imports use `@sagebionetworks/agora/<lib-name>` path aliases. Feature components also import from `@sagebionetworks/explorers/*` for shared comparison tool infrastructure.

## OpenAPI Workflow

Same pattern as described in the root `CLAUDE.md`. API contracts live in `api-description/`; the Angular HTTP client in `api-client-angular/` is fully generated.

After modifying any OpenAPI schema, always regenerate **all** generated clients -- not just `agora-api-description`. The `generate` target on client projects depends on `agora-api-description:build` automatically, so a single command handles the full chain:

```bash
# After any OpenAPI schema change, regenerate everything
nx run-many -t=generate -p=agora-*

# Bundle the OpenAPI specs only (rarely needed standalone)
nx build agora-api-description
```

## Charts Library

`agora-charts` contains standalone D3-based components. Each chart manages its own SVG lifecycle (`createChart`/`destroyChart` methods) and accepts data via `@Input()`. Charts use `HelperService` from `agora-services` for color schemes. Test setup files mock `ResizeObserver` and `SVGElement.getBBox` to support D3 in jsdom. For new charts, prefer ECharts via `libs/explorers/charts` and `libs/explorers/charts-angular` rather than D3.

## Testing Conventions

Tests use **Angular TestBed + ComponentFixture** (not `@testing-library/angular`). Mock data and service stubs come from `@sagebionetworks/agora/testing`.

## Code Style

This codebase predates the signals migration in the explorers/model-ad libraries. Existing code uses `@Input()`/`@Output()` decorators and RxJS `.subscribe()` — these are legacy patterns. New code should follow the modern Angular patterns in `.claude/rules/angular.md` (`input()`/`output()` signals, `inject()`). Do not proactively migrate existing legacy code unless it is directly relevant to the current task.
