    Given a source model component (see https://w3id.org/biolink/vocab/category
    for definnition of component), return all components required by it. Useful
    to construct requirement dependencies not only between specific attributes
    but also between categories/components of attributes; it can be utilized to
    track metadata completion progress across multiple categories of attributes.
