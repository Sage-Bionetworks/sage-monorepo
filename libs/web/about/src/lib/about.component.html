          The Challenge experience is currently cumbersome for all stakeholders
          involved. Participants encounter a huge pain-point in discovering
          Challenges they are interested in, while Organizers struggle to find a
          streamlined solution to reaching a wide audience.

        <p>
          The Registry of Community Challenges (ROCC) strives to address some of
          the friction in the Challenge experience by providing a centralized
          hub to reduce participant search cost and increasing Challenge
          visibility. Think of the ROCC like an EventBrite for the scientific
          benchmarking space!

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Sage Bionetworks strives to bridge the translational divide between
          biomedical research and clinical application by embracing open and
          reusable practices. One example is hosting scientific Challenges,
          galvanizing large communities of experts around new and complex
          biomedical problems. Aside from crowdsourcing biomedical problems,
          Challenges also seek to enable the robust assessment of tool
          performance (Ellrott, K., Buchanan, A., Creason, A. et al.)
        </p>
        <p>
          When done right, Challenges encourage innovation by promoting friendly
          competition to develop the best algorithms, evaluation with objective
          frameworks for assessment of these algorithms, and collaboration by
          bringing together new teams to uncover new insights. The Challenges
          ecosystem, however, is bottlenecked by the lack of a hub centralizing
          all biomedical challenges. Participants encounter a huge pain-point in
          discovering Challenges they are interested in, while Organizers
          struggle to find a streamlined solution to reaching a wide audience.
