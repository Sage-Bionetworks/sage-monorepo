            <h2>The ROCC Vision</h2>
            <p>The Challenge experience is currently cumbersome for all stakeholders involved. Participants
                encounter a
                huge pain-point in discovering Challenges they are interested in, while Organizers struggle to find
                a
                streamlined solution to reaching a wide audience.</p>
            <p>The Registry of Community Challenges (ROCC) strives to address some of the friction in the Challenge
                experience by providing a centralized hub to reduce participant search cost and increasing Challenge
                visibility. Think of the ROCC like an EventBrite for the scientific benchmarking space!</p>

              <h2>Background</h2>
              <p>Sage Bionetworks strives to bridge the translational divide between biomedical research and clinical
                  application by embracing open and reusable practices. One example is hosting scientific Challenges,
                  galvanizing large communities of experts around new and complex biomedical problems. Aside from
                  crowdsourcing biomedical problems, Challenges also seek to enable the robust assessment of tool
                  performance (Ellrott, K., Buchanan, A., Creason, A. et al.)</p>
              <p>When done right, Challenges encourage innovation by promoting friendly competition to develop the
                  best
                  algorithms, evaluation with objective frameworks for assessment of these algorithms, and
                  collaboration
                  by bringing together new teams to uncover new insights. The Challenges ecosystem, however, is
                  bottlenecked by the lack of a hub centralizing all biomedical challenges. Participants encounter a
                  huge
                  pain-point in discovering Challenges they are interested in, while Organizers struggle to find a
                  streamlined solution to reaching a wide audience.</p>

              <h2>The Problem</h2>
              <p>A successful Challenge requires both organizers and participants. While existing Challenge platforms
                  like
                  Synapse, Kaggle and EvalAI help connect organizers and participants and run challenges, the
                  visibility
                  of challenges is usually limited to the users of a specific challenge platform. The multiplication
                  of
                  challenge platforms and organizations leads to a lack of a central challenge hub that connects more
                  widely users at the level of the entire biomedical community. We summarize our target users as
                  follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Challenge Participants</strong> are typically researchers or engineers. They want to
                      solve
                      challenging biomedical problems while building their professional reputation, and discover
                      conference or Challenge opportunities to support both those aspirations.</li>
                  <li><strong>Challenge Organizers</strong> are often Principal Investigators and researchers. They
                      want
                      to host a successful Challenge event, where a diverse network of researchers come together and
                      spur
                      innovation, without too much event overhead.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Challenge participants face the headache of finding relevant challenges, while Challenge organizers
                  struggle with reaching the most wide and relevant audience. Here are the three biggest pain-points
                  we
                  hear from both sides:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Fragmented information ecosystem:</strong> over 25 organizations run biomedical
                      challenges,
                      each with their own website and social media channels (e.g: DREAM Challenges, CAFA, CAGI,
                      MICCAI,
                      TREC).</li>
                  <li><strong>Lack of standardizations:</strong> each of those 25+ organizations lays out Challenge
                      information differently, requiring organizers to repeatedly enter details on each site and
                      introducing a poor search experience for participants (e.g: searching for “carcinoma” instead of
                      “cancer” and etting zero results).</li>
                  <li><strong>High overhead with Challenge promotion:</strong> Organizers face high cognitive overload
                      due
                      to the need to identify the owners of multiple communication channels (e.g. mailing lists and
                      social
                      media accounts) currently required to widely connect with the biomedical community.</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>The ROCC aims to tackle each of these problems.</h4>
