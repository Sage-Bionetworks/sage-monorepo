# Since version 2.23 (released in August 2019), git-blame has a feature
# to ignore or bypass certain commits.
#
# This file contains a list of commits that are not likely what you
# are looking for in a blame, such as mass reformatting or renaming.
# You can set this file as a default ignore file for blame by running
# the following command.
#
# $ git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# Format:
# - List one commit hash per line.
# - You can include comments (lines starting with `#`) to provide context.
# - Append to the bottom of the file (revisions should be in chronological 
#   order from oldest to newest)
#
# Example:
# # Applied Prettier to the entire project
# 4d3c4d6a7b8c9e0f1234567890abcdef12345678
