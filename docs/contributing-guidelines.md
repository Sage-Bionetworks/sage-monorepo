A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to this project.

This project is a community effort and lives off your contributions, be it in
the form of bug reports, feature requests, discussions, or fixes and other code
changes.

Reading and following these guidelines will help us make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved. It also communicates that you
agree to respect the time of the developers managing and developing these open
source projects. In return, we will reciprocate that respect by addressing your
issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.


## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few
general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but,
  depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause.
  A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can
  help draw attention if your issue is blocking.
