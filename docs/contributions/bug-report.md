Issues should be used to report problems with this project, request a new feature, or to discuss
potential changes before a pull request (PR) is created. When you create a new issue, a template
will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to
investigate.

If you find an issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction
information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a reaction can also help
be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.
