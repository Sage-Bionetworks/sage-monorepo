PRs to our repositories are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your
fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread
  whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test
  suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo or on our [docs site].
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when
  a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes
(e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal
first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the [Forking Workflow]:

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name

   git checkout -b ＜new-branch＞ main

4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can
   efficiently review the changes.

We recommend that you add this repository as an [upstream remote] to your local
git repository so that you can fetch the latest updates.

```console
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/sage-monorepo.git
$ git remote -v
> ...
> upstream  https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/sage-monorepo.git (fetch)
> upstream  https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/sage-monorepo.git (push)
```

On your local machine make sure you have the latest version of the `main` branch
from this upstream repository:

```console
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```
