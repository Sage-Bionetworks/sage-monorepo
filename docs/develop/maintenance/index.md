# Dependency & Base Image Maintenance

This section documents how dependencies and Docker base images are maintained across the monorepo. It provides:

- Shared principles & workflows
- Tooling and automation overview (CI validation)
- Per-ecosystem maintenance guides (Java, Node/TypeScript, Python, Docker, etc.)

## Scope

Covers version management, update cadence, validation steps, and security considerations for:

- Application & library runtime dependencies
- Build tooling (compilers, test frameworks, linters)
- Infrastructure/runtime images (Docker base images)
- Version catalogs and lock files

## Goals

- Ensure consistent, reproducible builds
- Minimize upgrade risk via automation + validation
- Surface and remediate security vulnerabilities quickly
- Provide contributors a clear, repeatable process

## Update Cadence (Baseline)

| Category                | Patch/Minor            | Major                                | Security/Critical    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Java Libraries          | Weekly (batched)       | Quarterly or as needed               | ASAP (hotfix branch) |
| Node/TypeScript         | Weekly (Renovate)      | Framework-aligned (e.g., Angular/TS) | ASAP                 |
| Python                  | Bi-weekly or on-demand | Semiannual                           | ASAP                 |
| Docker Base Images      | Weekly digest scan     | As runtime LTS shifts                | ASAP                 |
| Dev Tooling (lint/test) | Weekly                 | With ecosystem majors                | ASAP                 |

(Adjust these values if policy differs.)

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Actor                    | Responsibility                                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Automation (?)           | Proposes routine updates, groups safe changes |
| Reviewer (Maintainer)    | Validates breaking changes, merges safe PRs   |
| Security Lead (optional) | Prioritizes CVE remediation                   |
| Release Manager          | Includes notable upgrades in release notes    |

## Standard Workflow

1. Automation or maintainer opens a branch / PR.
2. CI runs: build, tests, lint, security scan (if configured).
3. Reviewer validates:
   - No unexpected API breaks
   - Performance or memory not degraded (spot check)
   - Release notes for majors referenced
4. Merge with conventional commit message.
5. Aggregate dependency changes into periodic changelog / release notes.

## Branch & Commit Conventions

- Branch: `chore/deps/<ecosystem>-<yyyymmdd>` or `security/deps/<id>`
- Commit: `chore(deps): bump <lib> to <version>`
- For majors with breaking changes: include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer summarizing migration notes.

## Risk Categorization

| Risk Level | Indicators                                                | Action                                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Low        | Patch updates, clearly backward-compatible                | Auto-merge (if policy allows)              |
| Medium     | Minor updates with possible transitive shifts             | Manual review                              |
| High       | Major version, peer dependency shifts, build tool changes | Dedicated test focus, maybe staging deploy |
| Critical   | Security vulnerability fix                                | Expedite, limited scope branch             |

## Validation Checklist (Pre-Merge)

- [ ] All relevant tests pass
- [ ] Build artifacts produced successfully
- [ ] No new lint/type errors
- [ ] Version catalog / lock file updated (if applicable)
- [ ] For majors: migration notes reviewed
- [ ] For Docker: image builds locally and starts successfully
