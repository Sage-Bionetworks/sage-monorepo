  "terms": "By participating to this challenge, you accept to publicly share your submissions.\n\nYou can freely test your methods on this benchmark and compare yourself to the reference methods. When your development is finished or stable, please create a team with the following nomenclature : “Feature selection for DNAm” [met] + “Feature selection for RNA” [rna] / “Deconvolution method” [both]. The idea is to gather the similar approaches under the same team. Don’t hesitate to send an email to the organisers if you have any questions or issues.",

      "content": "Successful treatment of cancer is still a challenge and this is partly due to a wide heterogeneity of cancer composition across patient population. Unfortunately, accounting for such heterogeneity is very difficult. Clinical evaluation of tumor heterogeneity often requires the expertise of anatomical pathologists and radiologists.\n\nThis benchmark is dedicated to the quantification of intra-tumor heterogeneity using appropriate statistical methods on cancer omics data.\n\nIn particular, it focuses on estimating cell types and proportion in biological samples based on methylation and transcriptome data sets. The goal is to explore various statistical methods for source separation/deconvolution analysis (Non-negative Matrix Factorization, Surrogate Variable Analysis, Principal component Analysis, Latent Factor Models, …) using both RNA-seq and methylome data.\nHow to start ?\n\nThe goal of the benchmark is to quantify tumor heterogeneity : how many cell types are present and in which proportion?\nYou are provided with two simulated datasets from the same patient cohort (one transcriptome dataset, one methylone dataset).\n\n**Challenge 1: Estimate cell type heterogeneity from prancreatic transcriptomes**\n\nWe assume D is a (MxN) transcriptome matrix composed of transcriptome value for N samples, at M genes. Each sample is constituted of K cell types. We assume the following model: D = T A\n\nwith T an unknown (MxK) matrix of K cell type-specific transcriptome reference profiles (composed of M sites), and A an unknown (KxN) proportion matrix composed of K cell type proportions for each sample.\n\nParticipants have to identify an estimate of A matrix. Teams are invited to propose inovative methods using RNAseq approaches to estimate A.\n\n*  the transcriptome dataset is composed of 30 patients and 21566 genes, with cell types proportions highly variable between patients.\n\t\t\n**Challenge 2: Estimate cell type heterogeneity from prancreatic methylomes**\n\nWe assume D is a (MxN) methylome matrix composed of methylome value for N samples, at M probes. Each sample is constituted of K cell types. We assume the following model: D = T A\n\nwith T an unknown (MxK) matrix of K cell type-specific methylome reference profiles (composed of M sites), and A an unknown (KxN) proportion matrix composed of K cell type proportions for each sample.\n\nParticipants have to identify an estimate of A matrix. Teams are invited to propose inovative methods using DNA methylation approaches to estimate A.\n\n*  the methylome dataset is composed of 30 patients and 772316 methylation probes, with cell types proportions highly variable between patients.",

Then open R in the starting_kit directory, (e.g. open submission_script.R with RStudio).\n \nThe unziped starting_kit directory contains now:\n\n- A `submission_script.R` -> *to modify and to use to submit your code*\n- The `public_data_met.rds` -> *DNA methylation D matrix*\n-The `public_data_rna.rds` -> *transcriptome D matrix*\n \n[3] In the R console launch the following command (or run the `submission_script.R` in RStudio):\n\t\t \n\t\tsource(\"submission_script.R\")\n\n[4] The code of the  `submission_script.R`  generates the files:\n- `zip_program`  -> *for code submission, script format*\n-` zip_results`  -> *for result submission, table format*\n\nEdit the `submission_script.R` to replace the baseline method by the method of your choice. \n\n1) First, define the type of data you want to use to estimate tumor heterogeneity:\n\t\t data_test <- readRDS(file = \"public_data_rna.rds\") #Comment if you want to predict from methylome data\n\t\t#data_test <- readRDS(file = \"public_data_met.rds\") #Uncomment if you want to predict from methylome data\n\n2) Then, edit the code inside the following chunk (i.e. the `program` function): \n    \n\t\t## \n\t\t## YOUR CODE BEGINS HERE \n\t\t##\n\t\t\n\t\t##\n\t\t## YOUR CODE ENDS HERE\n\t\t## \n\n\tDon't forget to specify the `program` function parameter `k`, which corresponds to the number of cell types you want to estimate. It is set to `k=3` by default.\n\n**How to submit your results ?**\n\n[5] Now, let’s submit your code (`zip_program`) or your result (`zip_results` ) in the *My Submission* menu of the challenge.\n\n1) fill the metadata \n2) select the task you want to submit to and \n3) upload your submission files\n\nOn the  *My Submission* webpage,  the STATUS of your submission will go through the following steps :\n -> Submitting > Submitted > Running > Finished\n\n**How to see your score ?**\n\nWhen the status of your submission is finished (don't forget to refresh the page to update the status) :\n\n [6]  Click on the green button 'add to leaderboard' to see your score\n  \nBy clicking on your submission in the submissions summary table, you will access to:\n\n  - details of your submission (downloaded)\n\t-> submitted files, \n\t-> prediction results (ingestion output) \n\t-> scoring results (scoring outputs) \n\t\t\t\n  - some execution logs\n  \n  - a submission metadata edition menu\n  \n[7]  Check the leaderboard in the *Results*  menu",
