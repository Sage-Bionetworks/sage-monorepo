## Overview

## Add a file with DVC

```console
$ dvc add sage.png
100% Adding...|████████████████████████████████████████████|1/1 [00:00, 24.41file/s]

To track the changes with git, run:

        git add sage.png.dvc

To enable auto staging, run:

        dvc config core.autostage true
```

Now you can push data from your local machine to the AWS remote. First, add the data you want DVC to
track with the following command:

```console
$ git add sage.png.dvc
```

This will allow DVC to track the file `sage.png` so it will note when any changes are made. Then you
can push that data to your AWS remote with this command:

```console
$ dvc push
1 file pushed
```

The file `sage.png` is now stored in the S3 bucket, though under a different named generated by DVC
for performance reasons.

- Location: Amazon S3 > Buckets > gh-challenge > 74/ > 1d96c652588cd30c73150982b124d4
- Object URL: https://gh-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/74/1d96c652588cd30c73150982b124d4

## Pull data

Let's remove the file `sage.png` for the sake of this demonstration. Then, we can restore the file
with `dvc pull`.

```console
$ dvc pull
A       sage.png
1 file added
```

If we run the command again, DVC will tell us that everything is up to date.

```console
$ dvc pull
Everything is up to date.
```

## Update data

Unlink the file with `dvc unprotect`. This will make `sage.png` safe to edit:

```console
$ dvc unprotect sage.png
```


Let's now modify the file `sage.png` with our favorite image editor, then save it. Similarly to the
command `git status` that shows unstaged changes, we use the command `dvc status` for files tracked
with DVC.

```console
$ dvc status
sage.png.dvc:
        changed outs:
                modified:           sage.png
```


## Remove data

First, stop tracking the file by using `dvc remove` on the `.dvc` file. This will remove `sage.png`
from the workspace (and unlink it from the cache):

```console
dvc remove sage.png.dvc
```

Then stage the removal of `sage.png.dvc` with git.
