# June 2022

_Published on July 1, 2022_

Welcome to our June 2022 update! This month marked a transformative period for the Challenge Registry platform with [**43 pull requests**](#pull-requests-merged) merged to the main branch. Our development efforts were led by [@tschaffter](https://github.com/tschaffter), [@rrchai](https://github.com/rrchai), and [@vpchung](https://github.com/vpchung), focusing on major architectural restructuring, Java ecosystem expansion, and comprehensive UI modernization.

## Summary

- **Total Pull Requests**: 43 merged PRs
- **Key Focus**: Microservices architecture transformation and multi-application platform evolution
- **Major Projects**: Challenge Registry platform restructuring, Java shared libraries, UI v3 implementation

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Multi-application platform transformation

June represented a pivotal month in our platform evolution with the complete restructuring of the monorepo to support multi-application and microservice architecture. We implemented comprehensive project renaming conventions, established database service isolation with dedicated MariaDB, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL instances, and created standardized development workflows that support both standalone and integrated service deployment.

### Java ecosystem foundation

The introduction of shared Java libraries marked a significant milestone in our backend development strategy. We established Maven-based dependency management, implemented comprehensive linting and testing frameworks, and created reusable components that streamline microservice development across the platform ecosystem.

### User interface modernization initiative

Our frontend development reached new heights with the implementation of UI v3 design standards across critical user interfaces. We modernized the login experience, transformed navigation components with enhanced theming capabilities, and established consistent design patterns that improve both accessibility and user engagement throughout the platform.

### Development environment standardization

Significant improvements to our development infrastructure included comprehensive devcontainer integration, automated dependency caching in CI workflows, and enhanced project management tools. These changes ensure consistent development experiences across different environments while optimizing build performance and developer productivity.
