# March 2022

_Published on March 31, 2022_

Welcome to our March 2022 update! This month brought impressive development momentum with **[34 pull requests](#pull-requests-merged)** merged, primarily contributed by [@tschaffter](https://github.com/tschaffter) and [@vpchung](https://github.com/vpchung). March was a pivotal month focused on implementing comprehensive test coverage, establishing development workflows, and building out core platform features for the Challenge Registry.

## Summary

- **Total Pull Requests**: 34 merged PRs
- **Key Focus**: Test coverage implementation, CI/CD optimization, web application development
- **Major Projects**: Challenge Registry frontend development, development environment standardization, coverage reporting system

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Coverage reporting system

March introduced a comprehensive test coverage reporting system that aggregates coverage data across all TypeScript and Python projects in the monorepo. The implementation combines Jest for TypeScript testing with Python's coverage tools, automatically merging reports during CI/CD execution. This unified approach provides clear visibility into code quality metrics while supporting the diverse technology stack of the Sage ecosystem.

### Development environment standardization

The development workflow received significant improvements with the introduction of standardized development container configurations and streamlined dependency management. These changes eliminate environment-specific issues and provide consistent development experiences across different platforms. The new approach separates Docker-based deployment from local development requirements, making it easier for contributors to get started.

### Challenge Registry platform evolution

The Challenge Registry web application saw substantial progress with the implementation of core user interface components and routing infrastructure. The development focused on creating reusable component libraries and establishing clear architectural patterns for future feature development. The platform now supports user profiles, organization pages, and authentication workflows.
