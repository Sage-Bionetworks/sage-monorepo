# February 2022 Update

_Published on February 28, 2022_

Welcome to the very first monthly update for the Sage Monorepo! February 2022 marks the historic launch of our unified platform for biomedical research software development. This inaugural month saw **28 pull requests** merged by @tschaffter, establishing the foundational infrastructure that would support multiple scientific applications.

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Monorepo Foundation

February 2022 established a modern development platform built on **Nx workspace architecture**, providing powerful build optimization, dependency management, and affected-based testing. The foundation supports multiple programming languages (TypeScript, Python, Java, R) and enables efficient sharing of components across different applications and frameworks.

### Container-First Development

Docker integration was implemented from day one, ensuring consistent development environments across Windows, macOS, and Linux. The containerized approach includes both individual project containers and full-stack Docker Compose orchestration, enabling developers to spin up complete environments with a single command.

### API-First Design Philosophy

The platform adopted an OpenAPI specification-driven approach, where API documentation automatically generates client libraries and ensures consistency between backend services and frontend applications. This methodology streamlined development and maintained strong contracts between different system components.

### Cross-Framework Compatibility

A key architectural decision was implementing Web Components for UI sharing between different frontend frameworks. This approach allows Angular and React applications to share the same components, reducing duplication and ensuring consistent user experiences across different applications.

### Quality Assurance Automation

Comprehensive automation was built into the development workflow, including pre-commit hooks for linting, pre-push hooks for testing, and affected-based CI that only builds and tests changed code for optimal efficiency.
