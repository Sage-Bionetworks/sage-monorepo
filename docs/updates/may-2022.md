# May 2022

_Published on June 1, 2022_

Welcome to our May 2022 update! This month brought significant expansion in the Challenge Registry platform architecture with [**21 pull requests**](#pull-requests-merged) merged to the main branch. Our development efforts were led by [@tschaffter](https://github.com/tschaffter) and [@rrchai](https://github.com/rrchai), focusing on microservices architecture, authentication systems, and comprehensive platform tooling.

## Summary

- **Total Pull Requests**: 21 merged PRs
- **Key Focus**: Microservices architecture expansion and authentication infrastructure
- **Major Projects**: Keycloak integration, Challenge Service Registry, npm scope standardization

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Microservices infrastructure evolution

May marked a pivotal month in our platform architecture with the introduction of comprehensive microservices infrastructure. We established the Challenge Service Registry, API Gateway, and User Service foundations, creating a robust distributed system architecture that supports scalable challenge management.

### Authentication and authorization framework

The integration of Keycloak as our identity and access management solution represents a major architectural milestone. We implemented OAuth 2.0 authentication flows, established protected resource access patterns, and created the foundation for comprehensive user management across the platform ecosystem.

### Development environment modernization

Significant improvements to our development infrastructure included devcontainer integration with CI/CD workflows, comprehensive Docker composition updates, and enhanced documentation for remote development scenarios. These changes ensure consistent development experiences across different environments and deployment targets.

### Package management standardization

The transition to the `@sagebionetworks` npm scope aligns our JavaScript ecosystem with organizational standards and provides better package namespace management. This standardization supports future package publishing and cross-project dependency management.

## Community Impact

May's contributions represent a fundamental shift toward a mature, enterprise-ready platform architecture. The introduction of microservices patterns and comprehensive authentication systems positions the Challenge Registry as a scalable foundation for biomedical research collaboration.

The establishment of Keycloak-based authentication creates secure, standardized access patterns that will support future multi-tenant capabilities and fine-grained authorization controls. This infrastructure investment ensures the platform can grow to support larger research communities while maintaining security and performance standards.
