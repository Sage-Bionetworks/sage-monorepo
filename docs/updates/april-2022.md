# April 2022

_Published on May 1, 2022_

Welcome to our April 2022 update! This month brought continued progress in the Challenge Registry platform with [**15 pull requests**](#pull-requests-merged) merged to the main branch. Our development efforts were led by [@tschaffter](https://github.com/tschaffter) and [@rrchai](https://github.com/rrchai), focusing on foundational development tools, platform architecture, and user experience enhancements.

## Summary

- **Total Pull Requests**: 15 merged PRs
- **Key Focus**: Development environment standardization and testing infrastructure
- **Major Projects**: Challenge Registry platform development, HTML linting integration, UI component improvements

## Technical architecture overview

### Development environment standardization

April marked significant progress in establishing consistent development environments across the monorepo. We upgraded our development container infrastructure and implemented standardized tooling to ensure all contributors have access to the same development experience.

### Quality assurance framework expansion

We expanded our testing and linting capabilities by introducing HTML linting through webhint, complementing our existing JavaScript and TypeScript quality checks. This addition ensures our web applications maintain high standards for accessibility and semantic correctness.

### Platform infrastructure evolution

The Challenge Registry platform continued to grow with new page components and routing infrastructure. We established the foundation for challenge and organization search functionality, setting the stage for comprehensive challenge discovery features.

### User interface enhancement initiatives

Focused improvements to the About page styling and component testing coverage demonstrate our commitment to both user experience and code quality. These enhancements ensure our platform remains both visually appealing and technically robust.
