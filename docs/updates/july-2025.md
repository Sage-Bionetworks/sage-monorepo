# July 2025

_Published on July 31, 2025_

July 2025 marked a significant period of development across the Sage monorepo, with substantial progress in multiple key areas. This month saw **[85 pull requests](#all-pull-requests-merged)** merged, showcasing comprehensive enhancements to OpenChallenges platform infrastructure, major user interface improvements for Model-AD, modernization of API architectures, and continued evolution of platform tooling.

## Technical Architecture Overview

### OpenChallenges Platform Evolution

The team made significant strides in modernizing the OpenChallenges platform with comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for organizations, challenge platforms, and challenge resources. This included implementing proper REST standards for challenge contributions and participations, migrating API paths to kebab-case conventions, and establishing better data integrity through automatic challenge count calculations.

The platform also saw infrastructure improvements with the removal of dedicated API documentation containers in favor of external Swagger rendering, reducing operational costs by approximately $100 per environment annually.

### Model-AD User Experience Enhancements

July delivered major improvements to the Model-AD application's user interface, including the implementation of comprehensive boxplot visualization systems with selectors for biomarkers and pathology data. The team addressed critical accessibility issues for models with special characters in their names through proper URL encoding, added responsive design improvements for various viewport sizes, and implemented sticky table of contents navigation for better user experience.

Visual enhancements included improved y-axis formatting, proper genotype ordering, and mobile-responsive background imagery.

### API Modernization Initiative

A coordinated effort modernized API descriptions across multiple projects including Model-AD, AMP-ALS, and Agora. This involved transitioning from OpenAPI merge-based approaches to Redocly-based configurations, implementing consistent build processes with automatic cleanup tasks, and standardizing API documentation generation.

The modernization also included updating OpenAPI Generator versions and establishing consistent tag naming conventions across services.

### Infrastructure and Tooling Updates

The development environment saw significant improvements with the migration to Storybook v9, bringing enhanced developer experience and resolving security vulnerabilities. The team also completed the renaming of the BioArena project to BixArena, reflecting organizational changes.

Quality assurance improvements included enhanced data version management with bumps to Model-AD data mv69 and Agora data mv73.

### Developer Experience and Standards

July emphasized improving developer workflows through better task configurations, enhanced testing capabilities, and standardized project structures. The team implemented profile-specific configuration files for better environment management and established more robust unit and integration testing frameworks for OpenChallenges services.
