Issues should be used to report problems with this project, request a new
feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create
a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting
and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your
own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new
one. Adding a [reaction] can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a
particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.
