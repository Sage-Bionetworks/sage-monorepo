# MkDocs Integration Guide

This document explains how the `docs/` directory is integrated with the MkDocs site.

## Navigation Configuration

The MkDocs site uses explicit navigation configuration to ensure the sidebar navigation remains visible when browsing Technical Documentation pages.

### How It Works

Overview pages are listed in the `nav` section of [mkdocs.yml](../mkdocs.yml):

```yaml
nav:
  - Technical Documentation:
      - Overview: overview.md
      - RFCs: rfcs/README.md
      - Architecture: architecture/README.md
      - ADRs: adr/README.md
```

Users navigate to individual RFCs, Architecture docs, and ADRs through links in the overview pages. This keeps the navigation clean and manageable.

## Directory Structure

```
docs/
├── .mkdocs-integration.md     # This file (not shown in site)
├── overview.md                # Overview page
├── rfcs/
│   ├── README.md             # RFC overview
│   └── *.md                  # RFC documents (add to mkdocs.yml nav)
├── architecture/
│   ├── README.md             # Architecture overview
│   ├── *.md                  # Architecture docs (add to mkdocs.yml nav)
│   └── diagrams/
│       ├── README.md
│       └── *.gif, *.svg      # Diagrams
└── adr/
    ├── README.md             # ADR overview
    └── *.md                  # ADR documents (add to mkdocs.yml nav)
```

## Adding New Content

### Adding an RFC

1. Create your RFC: `docs/rfcs/NNNN-product-brief-title.md`
2. Update `docs/rfcs/README.md` to list it in the Active RFCs table
3. No need to update `mkdocs.yml` - users navigate via the RFC overview page

### Adding an Architecture Document

1. Create your document: `docs/architecture/my-feature-plan.md`
2. Update `docs/architecture/README.md` to reference it in the index
3. No need to update `mkdocs.yml` - users navigate via the Architecture overview page

### Adding an ADR

1. Create your ADR: `docs/adr/0001-my-decision.md`
2. Update `docs/adr/README.md` to list it in the Active ADRs table
3. No need to update `mkdocs.yml` - users navigate via the ADR overview page

### Adding a Diagram

1. Save your diagram: `docs/architecture/diagrams/my-diagram.svg`
2. Reference it from your architecture doc using relative path:
   ```markdown
   ![Architecture](./diagrams/my-diagram.svg)
   ```
3. Update `docs/architecture/README.md` to list it in the diagrams table

## RFCs (Included)

The `docs/rfcs/` directory is included in the MkDocs site for better visibility of active proposals. Once an RFC is approved:

1. Move the file to `docs/architecture/`
2. Update status in both `rfcs/README.md` and `architecture/README.md`

## Navigation Simplicity

Individual RFCs, Architecture docs, and ADRs are **not** listed in `mkdocs.yml`. Users navigate to them through links in the overview pages (README.md files). This keeps the navigation clean and easy to maintain.

## Local Preview

To preview the MkDocs site locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync --group dev

# Serve the site
mkdocs serve
```

Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Build Verification

After making changes, verify the site builds correctly:

```bash
# Build the site
mkdocs build

# Verify pages were built
ls site/rfcs/ site/architecture/ site/adr/
```

You should see `index.html` files for all the documentation pages.
