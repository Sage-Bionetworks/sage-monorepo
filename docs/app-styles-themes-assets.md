# App Styles, Themes and Assets

## Overview

This document describes how SCSS styles, themes and assets are organized across a web app and its
libraries.

## File Structure

Each Angular component has its own style file (css, scss, less, etc). When building the app, Angular
includes the component style files into the app style bundle. Additional styling files are used in
our applications. These files are organized as shown below.

```console
apps/
└─ web-app/
   └─ src/
      ├─ _app-themes.scss               <---- app styles (2)
      ├─ index.html
      └─ styles.scss                    <---- app styles (1)
dist/
└─ apps/
   └─ web-app/
      ├─ index.html
      └─ styles.<hash>.css              <---- app style bundle (7)
libs/
├─ shared/
│  ├─ assets/                           <---- cross-app assets
│  ├─ styles/                           <---- cross-app styles (5)
│  └─ themes/                           <---- cross-app assets (6)
└─ web/
   ├─ assets/                           <---- app-specific assets
   ├─ styles/                           <---- app-specific styles (3)
   └─ themes/                           <---- app-specific assets (4)
```

1. The app style - This file imports the app styles defined in the app library `libs/web/styles` and
   the app themes defined in `apps/web-app/src/_app-themes.scss`. This file is referenced in the
   build options defined in the `project.json` of the app.
2. The app theme - This file defines the theme configuration of the app (color and typography). This
   file imports the themes defined in the app library `libs/web/themes`.
3. The app styles library - This library defines the styles of the application. This library extends
   the cross-app styles defined in `libs/shared/styles`.
4. The app themes library - This library references the theme files of all the components defined in
   `libs/web`.
5. The cross-app style library - This library defines styles shared accross applications.
6. The cross-app theme library - This library defined themes shared across applications.
7. The app style bundle - This bundle includes the styles of the Angular components as well as the
   app style and theme files of the app.

Assets like images are used in HTML and SCSS files. Assets that are shared across applications are
stored in `libs/shared/assets`. Assets that are specific to an app are located in
`libs/<app>/assets` (e.g., where `libs/web/assets`). In order to use these assets in the app and
libraries of the `web-app` application, the path to the asset folders are referenced in the build
options of the app (see `project.json`). This is also where a prefix is defined to distinguish the
asset files from these libraries. This example shows how to import an image from the cross-app and
app-specific asset libraries.

```html
<img src="/shared-assets/images/github.png">
<img src="/challenge-registry-assets/images/challenge-view-header-background.png">
```

## Applying a theme to a component

Create a file named `_<component>-theme.scss` that will be used to apply a theme to a component.
While the style file of a component is responsible for the layout of the component, the theme file
is responsible for defining the colors and typography of the component.

```console
$ ls -1 libs/web/about/src/lib/
about.component.html
about.component.scss                   <---- style file
about.component.spec.ts
about.component.ts
about.module.ts
_about-theme.scss                      <---- theme file
```

Seed the theme file with the following template:

```scss
@use 'sass:map';
@use '@angular/material' as mat;

@mixin color($theme) {
  $config: mat.get-color-config($theme);
  $primary: map.get($config, primary);
  $accent: map.get($config, accent);
  $warn: map.get($config, warn);
  $background: map.get($config, background);
  $foreground: map.get($config, foreground);

  // Specify the colors of the elements of the component here.
  // Example:
  .awesome-class {
    color: mat.get-color-from-palette($primary, default);
  }
}

@mixin typography($theme) {
  $config: mat.get-typography-config($theme);

  // Specify the typography of the elements of the component here.
  // Example:
  .awesome-class {
    font-family: mat.font-family($config);
    font-size: mat.font-size($config);
    font-weight: mat.font-weight($config);
  }
}

@mixin theme($theme) {
  $color-config: mat.get-color-config($theme);
  @if $color-config != null {
    @include color($theme);
  }

  $typography-config: mat.get-typography-config($theme);
  @if $typography-config != null {
    @include typography($theme);
  }
}
```

Reference the theme file created in the index theme file `_lib-theme.scss` of the library you are
working on.

```scss
@use './lib/<component>-theme';                  <---- import theme file
@use './lib/<component-2>-theme';

@mixin theme($theme) {
  @include <component>-theme.theme($theme);      <---- reference theme file
  @include <component-2>-theme.theme($theme);
}
```

If you are creating a new library, you need to reference the library index theme file in the index
file of the `themes` library of the application. The `themes` library of the application `web-app`
is located in `libs/web/themes`. Open its index file `libs/web/themes/src/_index.scss` and add the
reference to the index theme file of the new library.

```scss
@use 'libs/web/<lib>/src/lib-theme' as web-<lib>;
@use 'libs/web/<lib-2>/src/lib-theme' as web-<lib-2>;

@mixin theme($theme) {
  @include web-<lib>.theme($theme);
  @include web-<lib-2>.theme($theme);
}
```

The theme defined for the application should now be applied to the component.
