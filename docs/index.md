## Overview

The Sage Monorepo is a comprehensive development platform that enables teams to build and deploy biomedical research applications faster and more efficiently. By centralizing shared components, standardizing development practices, and providing modern tooling, we eliminate the problems of siloed development, duplicated efforts, and reduced maintainability.

## Why Sage Monorepo?

**Build Products, Not Build Systems** - Focus on what matters: solving biomedical research challenges, not wrestling with development infrastructure.

- **Shared Components**: Reusable libraries and components across all projects
- **Modern Tooling**: Nx workspace with TypeScript, Angular, Java, Python, and R support
- **Streamlined CI/CD**: Automated testing, building, and deployment workflows
- **Developer Experience**: Enhanced productivity with intelligent caching and task orchestration

Developers building components in silos can lead to a number of problems, including duplicated
components, increased maintenance, and reduced visibility.

Sage Monorepo addresses these problems by providing a centralized repository for standardized,
reusable components. This solution also improves the developer experience (DX), which can lead to
increased morale, productivity, retention, and knowledge transfer.

## Key Features

- Build apps faster
- Use latest technologies
- Open-source
