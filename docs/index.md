Developers building components in silos can lead to a number of problems, including duplicated
components, increased maintenance, and reduced visibility.

Sage Monorepo addresses these problems by providing a centralized repository for standardized,
reusable components. This solution also improves the developer experience (DX), which can lead to
increased morale, productivity, retention, and knowledge transfer.

## Key Features

- Build apps faster
- Use latest technologies
- Open-source
