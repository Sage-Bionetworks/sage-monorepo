# Developing inside a Container

## Overview

This document describes how to configure and develop in the dev container specified by this
repository. The goal is to provide developers with the same development environment that is mainly
isolated from their host. This method promotes reproducibility and remove the need to install
dependencies on the host such as Node.js or Python. For additional information on VS Code
development containers, see [Developing inside a Container].

## Requirements

- [Docker]
- [VS Code] and the extension [Remote - Containers]

## Quick Start

Open the workspace folder in VS Code after cloning it. VS Code should invite you to open the folder
in the dev container specified by this repository. Alternatively:

- Press `F1` or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (macOS) or
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Windows) or click on `Help` > `Show All Commands`
- Enter `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...`

That's it! VS Code should now have open the workspace folder in the dev container as indicated by
the following green button displayed in the bottom-left corner of VS Code.

To reopen the workspace folder locally, click on the above green button and select `Reopen Folder
Locally` or `Reopen Folder in WSL` when developing on Windows with WSL.

## Sharing Git credentials with the container

To run `git` commands that require authentication inside the dev container, please follow the
instructions described in [Sharing Git credentials with your container].

If this repository has been closed using an SSH key, follow the instructions to share your host SSH
keys with the dev container. The command below should list the same keys when executed on the host
and inside the container.

    ssh-add -l

[Signing commits requires a GPG key]. Follow the above instructions to share the host GPG keys with
the dev container. The command below should now list the same keys when executed on the host and
inside the container.

    gpg --list-keys
