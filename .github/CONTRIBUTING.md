# Contribution Guide

A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to this project.

This project is a community effort and lives off your contributions, be it in
the form of bug reports, feature requests, discussions, or fixes and other code
changes.

Reading and following these guidelines will help us make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved. It also communicates that you
agree to respect the time of the developers managing and developing these open
source projects. In return, we will reciprocate that respect by addressing your
issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Code of Conduct

We take our open source community seriously and hold ourselves and other
contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and
contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct].

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few
general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but,
  depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause.
  A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can
  help draw attention if your issue is blocking.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with this project, request a new
feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create
a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting
and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your
own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new
one. Adding a [reaction] can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a
particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our repositories are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your
fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread
  whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test
  suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo or on our [docs site].
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when
  a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes
(e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal
first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the [Forking Workflow]:

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name

       git checkout -b ＜new-branch＞ main

4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can
   efficiently review the changes.

We recommend that you add this repository as an [upstream remote] to your local
git repository so that you can fetch the latest updates.

```console
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/sage-monorepo.git
$ git remote -v
> ...
> upstream  https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/sage-monorepo.git (fetch)
> upstream  https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/sage-monorepo.git (push)
```

On your local machine make sure you have the latest version of the `main` branch
from this upstream repository:

```console
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```
