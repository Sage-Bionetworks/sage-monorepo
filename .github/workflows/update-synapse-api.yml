      # NOTE: The devcontainer image sets its default USER to 'ubuntu'. We override to root here
      # (via --user root) so early framework mechanics (actions/checkout writing state files under
      # $RUNNER_TEMP, file command APIs, etc.) are guaranteed to have write permission to the mounted
      # runner directories without pre-adjusting ownership. After checkout we immediately drop
      # privileges for build / generation by chowning only $GITHUB_WORKSPACE and invoking commands
      # with 'sudo -u ubuntu'.
      #
      # Why not stay ubuntu from the start? When the workspace and temp mounts arrive owned by root
      # (common when the host bind mounts into the container), starting as ubuntu can cause EACCES
      # on state files (e.g. /__w/_temp/_runner_file_commands/save_state_*). Forcing root avoids the
      # race/permission edge cases and lets us perform a controlled, minimal privilege drop.
      #
      # Principles followed:
      #  * Do NOT chown $RUNNER_TEMP or $RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE (runner-managed, can break file commands)
      #  * Only chown the repository workspace before running unprivileged steps
      #  * Use 'sudo -u ubuntu' for generation so artifacts are not root-owned
      #  * Keep the privileged window as small as possible

            ## Description

            This is an automated update triggered by changes detected in the Synapse OpenAPI specification.

            The workflow downloads the latest specification and regenerates dependent generated projects (clients, docs, etc.) to keep them in sync.

            ## Review checklist

            - [ ] Verify that the API changes are expected
            - [ ] Check that generated artifacts build/compile successfully
            - [ ] Run tests to ensure compatibility
            - [ ] Review any breaking changes in the API
