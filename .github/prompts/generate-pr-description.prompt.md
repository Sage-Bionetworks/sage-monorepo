# Generate PR Description Prompt

## Objective
Generate a comprehensive, professional pull request description that follows the repository's GitHub template standards and provides clear documentation of all changes made in the feature branch.

## Context Requirements
Before generating the PR description, gather the following information:

### 1. Pull Request Analysis
- [ ] Get the active pull request details using GitHub MCP server
- [ ] Analyze all file changes in the PR (additions, deletions, modifications)
- [ ] Identify the scope and purpose of the changes
- [ ] Determine the primary technology stack involved (Java, TypeScript, Python, etc.)

### 2. Repository Context
- [ ] Confirm the repository name, owner, and branch information
- [ ] Identify the target merge branch (usually `main`)
- [ ] Check for related issues or Jira tickets
- [ ] Understand the monorepo structure and affected applications/libraries

### 3. Technical Analysis
- [ ] Categorize changes by type (feature, bugfix, chore, refactor, etc.)
- [ ] Identify breaking changes or API modifications
- [ ] Document configuration changes (build files, application properties, etc.)
- [ ] Note database schema changes or migrations
- [ ] Identify test updates or new test coverage

## Template Structure
Generate the PR description using this exact format:

```markdown
## Description

[Provide a clear, concise summary of what this PR accomplishes. Focus on the business value and technical impact. Explain WHY these changes were made, not just WHAT was changed.]

## Related Issue

[If applicable, link to Jira ticket or GitHub issue]
Fixes [ISSUE-NUMBER](link-to-issue)

## Changelog

[List all significant changes in bullet points. Group related changes together. Be specific but concise:]

- [Change description with technical details]
- [Change description with technical details]
- [Continue for all major changes...]

## Preview

The [component/service/application] now has:
- [Key improvement or feature]
- [Key improvement or feature]
- [Key improvement or feature]
- [Continue for all major accomplishments...]
```
