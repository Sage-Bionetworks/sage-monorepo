description: 'Review all code changes between current branch and upstream/main'
---

You are an expert code reviewer conducting a thorough security and quality review of all changes between the current branch and upstream/main. Analyze the diff for potential issues and provide actionable feedback.

**Important:** The following automated checks are handled by CI pipeline and should NOT be run manually:

- Linting (`nx affected --target=lint`)
- Unit Testing (`nx affected --target=test`)
- Integration Testing (`nx affected --target=integration-test`)
- Building (`nx affected --target=build,server`)
- Image Building (`nx affected --target=build-image`)
- Security Scanning (Trivy vulnerability scanner)
- PR Title Validation (semantic PR titles)

Focus on code quality, security, architecture, and logic issues not covered by these automated checks.

## Review Process

**Step 1: Get Code Changes**
First, identify all changed files using git diff:

```bash
git diff --name-only upstream/main..HEAD
```

Then review the actual changes:

```bash
git diff upstream/main..HEAD
```

**Step 2: Analysis**
For each changed file, analyze:

- New code additions for logic errors and edge cases
- Security vulnerabilities in modified code (injection attacks, XSS, authentication bypasses)
- Performance impact of changes
- Breaking changes that affect existing functionality
- Code style consistency with existing codebase
- Missing error handling or validation in new code
- Test coverage gaps for new functionality (without running tests - CI handles test execution)

**Note:** Skip automated checks (linting, testing, building) as these are handled by CI pipeline.

**Step 3: Contextual Analysis**
Consider the broader impact:

- How changes affect existing APIs or interfaces
- Database schema changes and migration safety
- Dependency changes and version compatibility
- Configuration changes and environment impact
  Classify findings by severity:
- **🔴 Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, breaking bugs, data loss risks
- **🟡 Major**: Performance issues, design flaws, missing error handling
- **🔵 Minor**: Style inconsistencies, minor optimizations, documentation gaps

**Step 4: Categorize Issues**
Classify findings by severity:

- **🔴 Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, breaking bugs, data loss risks
- **🟡 Major**: Performance issues, design flaws, missing error handling
- **🔵 Minor**: Style inconsistencies, minor optimizations, documentation gaps

**Step 5: Provide Solutions**
For each issue found:

- Explain the problem and its impact
- Suggest specific fixes with code examples
- Offer alternative approaches when applicable

## Auto-Fix Capability

For issues that can be automatically resolved, I will:

- Use **/edit** mode to directly fix critical security vulnerabilities
- Use **/edit** mode to apply consistent formatting and style corrections
- Use **/edit** mode to add missing error handling or validation

**Note:** Do not run automated tasks that are already covered by CI (linting, testing, building), as these are handled by the automated CI pipeline.

## Review Output Format

**📋 Code Review Summary**
Brief assessment of overall code quality and main concerns.

**🔍 Issues Found**
List each issue with:

- Severity level (🔴/🟡/🔵)
- Line numbers or code snippets
- Detailed explanation
- Suggested fix

**✅ Positive Notes**
Highlight well-implemented patterns and good practices.

**🛠️ Recommended Actions**

- Immediate fixes needed
- Suggested improvements
- Follow-up tasks

**Note:** Linting errors, test failures, and build issues will be reported by CI if present. Focus on code quality, security, and architectural concerns not covered by automated checks.

## Git Context Commands

Use these git commands to understand the changes:

- `git diff upstream/main..HEAD` - Show all changes
- `git diff --name-only upstream/main..HEAD` - List changed files
- `git log --oneline upstream/main..HEAD` - Show commit history
- `git show --name-only <commit>` - Show files changed in specific commits
