# Weekly Update Instructions

This document provides instructions for generating a standardized weekly update for the sage-monorepo project.

## Purpose

The weekly update aims to:

1. Summarize progress across multiple projects in the monorepo
2. Highlight key contributions by team members
3. Provide a clear overview for both technical and non-technical stakeholders
4. Maintain consistent formatting and structure across updates

## Structure

The weekly update should follow this consistent structure:

### 1. Header

```markdown
# Sage-Bionetworks/sage-monorepo Weekly Update

[Current Date Range, e.g., July 5-12, 2025]
```

### 2. Highlights (üåü)

A brief paragraph (2-3 sentences) summarizing the main achievements of the week. This should be high-level and accessible to all readers.

### 3. Project Updates (üìä)

Break down updates by project area. For each project:

- Include a brief introduction sentence
- List key updates as bullet points with:
  - Bold headers for each update
  - Brief description of the change/feature
  - Contributors in parentheses (@username)

Common project areas include:

- Model-AD Platform
- OpenChallenges Platform
- Agora Platform
- Explorers Framework
- Bioarena Project

### 4. Technical Improvements (üõ†Ô∏è)

Group technical improvements by category:

- Infrastructure Enhancements
- Angular Modernization
- Testing Infrastructure
- Other relevant categories based on the week's work

For each category, include bullet points with:

- Bold headers for specific improvements
- Brief description
- Contributors (@username)

### 5. Contributors (üë•)

List all contributors for the week with their PR counts:

```markdown
This week's progress was made possible by the following contributors:

- @username1 - X PRs
- @username2 - Y PRs
  ...
```

### 6. Coming Next (üîÆ)

A brief paragraph about upcoming focus areas and expected work for the next week.

## Formatting Guidelines

1. **Use emoji** for section headers to make the document visually engaging
2. **Bold key terms** in bullet points for scannability
3. **Include contributor handles** (@username) for all work
4. **Keep descriptions concise** but informative
5. **Use consistent styling** throughout the document

## Data Collection Process

1. Review PRs merged in the specified date range:

   - Use `mcp_github_list_commits` to fetch commits for each PR
   - Analyze commit messages for details on changes

2. Identify contributors:

   - Note PR creators
   - Check for co-authors mentioned in commit messages
   - Count total PRs per contributor

3. Group changes by project area and type:
   - Look for prefixes in commit messages (e.g., "feat(openchallenges)")
   - Group similar technical improvements together

## Example Format

```markdown
# Sage-Bionetworks/sage-monorepo Weekly Update

2. **Acknowledge all contributors**, even for small contributions
3. **Group related changes** together for readability
4. **Highlight cross-cutting improvements** that benefit multiple projects
5. **Use consistent terminology** with the development team
